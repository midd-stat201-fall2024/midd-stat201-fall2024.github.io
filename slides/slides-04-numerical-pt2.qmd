## Interpreting SD

We learned about the sample mean $\bar{x}$, the sample variance $s^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^2$, and the sample standard deviation $s = \sqrt{s^2}$

-   Why care about standard deviation (SD)? Describes how far data are distributed from their mean

-   Usually (but not always!!) about 70% of the data will be within one SD of the mean, and 95% will be within two SDs

    -   These percentages are not precise, but are useful for intuition

    -   We will come back to this later in semester

## Visualizing SD

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, messabundance = F)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
plot_theme <- theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
```

```{r echo = F}
insurance <- read_csv("data/insurance.csv")

ggplot(insurance, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$bmi), col = "orange", size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$bmi) - sd(insurance$bmi), 
             col = "purple", size = 1, linetype = "dashed")+
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$bmi) + sd(insurance$bmi), 
             col = "purple", size = 1, linetype = "dashed")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$bmi) - 2*sd(insurance$bmi), 
             col = "blue", size = 1, linetype = "dashed")+
    geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$bmi) + 2*sd(insurance$bmi), 
             col = "blue", size = 1, linetype = "dashed")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  labs(caption = "orange = sample mean, purple = 1 SD, blue = 2 SD")


  # facet_wrap(~smoker)
```

## Visualizing SD (cont.)

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$charges), col = "orange", size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$charges) - sd(insurance$charges), 
             col = "purple", size = 1, linetype = "dashed")+
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$charges) + sd(insurance$charges), 
             col = "purple", size = 1, linetype = "dashed")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  labs(caption = "orange = sample mean, purple = 1 SD")
```

::: fragment
We know how to calculate some summary statistics and interpret them alongside the histogram. But wouldn't it be great if we had a visualization that directly displays some summary statistics?
:::

## Boxplot

Another commonly used visualization to display the distribution of a numerical variable is the **boxplot**. Boxplots are created using five statistics and identify unusual observations.

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +
  xlab("Charges ($)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20))
```

-   Does the orientation (vertical or horizontal) matter?

## Median

-   The (sample) **median** $m$ is another common measure of center of a distribution. It is the value of the data distribution where 50% of the data are less than $m$ and 50% of the data are greater than $m$.

    -   If we order the data from smallest to largest, the median is the value in the middle.
    -   If the number of observations $n$ is even, then there will be two values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average

-   ::: discuss
    Consider the following data: $\boldsymbol{x} =116, 114, 112, 121, 108, 113, 129, 118, 119, 115$. What is the median?
    :::

-   The median is also known the 50th ***percentile*** because 50% of the data fall below $m$

## Quartiles

-   The 25th percentile is the value of data with 25% of values below it. Special name: **first quartile** $Q_{1}$

-   The 75th percentile is the value of data with 75% of values below it. Special name: **third quartile** $Q_{3}$

-   ::: discuss
    What percent of the data fall between $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$? What percent of the data fall between $Q_{1}$ and the median?
    :::

-   How to calculate? Suppose we have $2q$ (even) or $2q + 1$ (odd) number of values

    -   $Q_{1}$ is the median of the $q$ smallest values

    -   $Q_{3}$ is the median of the $q$ largest values

-   ::: discuss
    What are $Q_{1}$ and $Q_{3}$ of the data $\boldsymbol{x}$?
    :::

## Interquartile range

The **interquartile range** (**IQR**) is another measure of variability/spread in the data.

$$
IQR = Q_{3} - Q_{1}
$$

-   If the data are more spread out data, should the IQR increase or decrease?
-   What is the IQR of the data $\boldsymbol{x}$?

::: notes
IQR are not the values themselves, but rather, the spread of the middle 50% of the data. Interpretation once again depends on the scale of the data.

Q3 = 119 and Q1 = 113 -\> IQR = 6
:::

## Creating the boxplot

-   The "box" part of the boxplot is created using $Q_{1}$, $m$, and $Q_{3}$

-   Then we draw out **whiskers** from the box that attempt to capture data outside the IQR

    -   How long should the whiskers be? There isn't a fixed rule, but $1.5 \times IQR$ below $Q_1$ and above $Q_{3}$ is common
    -   We should "cut off" the whiskers to be true to the data

-   Lastly, we add dots for any cases that lie beyond the whiskers

    -   These points are unusually high/low compared to the rest of the data and are worth identifying as *potential* outliers

    -   An **outlier** is an observation that appears extreme relative to the rest of the data

-   Let's draw a boxplot for the data $\boldsymbol{x}$!

## A note on outliers

-   ::: discuss
    Why are we interested in identifying outliers?
    :::

    -   Identifying strong skew

    -   Identifying possible data collection/data entry errors

    -   Providing insight into interesting properties of the data

-   Are outliers necessarily indicative of a problem in the data?

## Histograms vs boxplots

::: discuss
What characteristics of the distribution are apparent in the histogram and not in the box plot? What characteristics are apparent in the box plot but not in the histogram?
:::

## Robust statistics

```{r}
x <- c(116, 114, 112, 121, 108, 113, 129, 118, 119, 115)
x2 <- c(x, 170)
```

-   In the data $\boldsymbol{x} = 116, 114, 112, 121, 108, 113, 129, 118, 119, 115$ that we have been working with, we have the following sample statistics:

::: fragment
$\qquad \bar{x} =$ `r round(mean(x),1)`, $s =$ `r round(sd(x),1)`, $m =$ `r round(median(x), 1)` , $IQR =$ 6
:::

-   ::: discuss
    Suppose we actually observed an additional data point with a value of $170$. What are the sample statistics with this additional data point? How do they compare to the values above?

    $\bar{x}' =$ `r round(mean(x2),1)`, $s' =$ `r round(sd(x2),2)`, $m' =$ \_\_\_\_\_, $IQR' =$ \_\_\_\_\_
    :::

-   **Robust statistics** are statistics that are minimally affected by extreme values

    -   Which of the statistics above would be considered robust?

-   ::: discuss
    When should the mean be similar to the median (and the standard deviation similar to the IQR)?
    :::

::: notes
m' = 116

Q1' = 113, Q3' = 121, IQR' = 8
:::

## Mean vs. Median

```{r}
ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$charges), col = "orange", size = 2) +
   geom_vline(xintercept = median(insurance$charges), col = "yellow", size =2)+
  plot_theme +
  ggtitle("Insurance charges") +
  labs(caption = "Orange = sample mean, yellow = sample median")
```

Which is better measure of center? The mean or the median?

## Comparing numerical data across groups

-   While we haven't yet discussed categorical data, it is common to want to visualize the distribution of a numerical variable across different groups/levels of a categorical variable

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(insurance, aes(y = smoker, x = charges)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  plot_theme

p2 <- ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges, col = smoker, fill = smoker)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
  plot_theme

p3 <- ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges)) +
  geom_histogram()+
  facet_wrap(~smoker) +
  theme(text =element_text(size = 14),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45))

gridExtra::grid.arrange(grobs =list(p1,p2,p3), ncol = 2)
```


## Transforming data

-   When data are strongly skewed or take on an "inconvenient" range of values, we might transform them so they are easier to work with

-   A **transformation** rescales the data using a function

    -   e.g. $f(x) = e^x$, $f(x) = \log_{10}(x)$, $f(x) = \ln(x)$, $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$

    -   The exact transformation you choose depends heavily on the data!!

::: fragment
```{r fig.height=3}
p1 <- ggplot(insurance, aes(x = charges)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  plot_theme

p2<- ggplot(insurance, aes(x = log(charges, base = 10))) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  xlab(expression("log" [10] ~ "(charges)")) +
  plot_theme

gridExtra::grid.arrange(grobs =list(p1,p2), ncol = 2)
```

## Summary

-   Boxplots are another univariate visualization for numerical data

-   Median and IQR are *robust* to outliers, whereas mean and standard deviation are *sensitive* to outliers

-   When should we prefer median over mean (or vice versa)?

::: notes
Median is more stable; not affected by one single data point. But mean is easier to compute than median since you do not have sort observations. Also, mean has nice theoretical properties (STAT 311). If possible, always good to calculate both!!

Median = what is typical, mean = what you expect. The typical charge amount is around \$9000. But if you're looking at insurance charges, you shouldn't expect to pay that low amount.
