## Housekeeping

-   Office hours tomorrow: 10:30am-12:00pm

```{r echo = F, message= F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, messabundance = F)
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
plot_theme <- theme(text = element_text(size = 24))
source("../stat201_fns.R")
```

## Recap

-   We have seen how to perform hypothesis tests for questions involving the following:

    -   A single proportion (STAT 201 sleep)

    -   Independence of two categorical variables (banker sex discrimination)

        -   Think of as one population

    -   Difference in two proportions (blood thinner)

        -   Think of as two populations

-   We are now going to see another hypothesis test, this time for *numerical* data

# Test for a single mean

## Running example + form hypotheses

We will use the `duke_forest` dataset provided in `openintro`. It provides data on some houses that were sold in the Duke Forest neighborhood of Durham, NC in November 2020.

-   Before we look at the data, we should form our hypotheses. Suppose I am interested in learning if the average price of houses in Duke Forest is \$500,000 or not.

-   ::: discuss
    What might our hypotheses be?
    :::

    -   $H_{0}$: $\mu = 50$ versus $H_{A}$: $\mu \neq 50$, where $\mu$ is the average house of prices in Duke Forest in \$10,000
    -   Terminology: I will refer to $\mu_{0} = 50$ as my "null hypothesized value". (i.e. the specific value of $\mu$ in $H_{0}$)

## Collect data

```{r}
library(openintro)
prices <- duke_forest$price/10000
n <- length(prices)
xbar <- round(mean(prices), 3)
```

```{r}
ggplot(duke_forest, aes(x = prices)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Housing prices in Duke Forest ($10k)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 24))
```

The observed/sample mean housing price is \$`r xbar`k from a sample of `r n` houses.

-   Now we must determine if we have "convincing evidence"! Choose $\alpha = 0.05$

## Simulating null distribution

To simulate from the null distribution, we need to operate in a world where $H_{0}$ is true

-   So, I need to repeatedly simulate data sets of size `r n` where the true mean is $50$, without change anything else about the data sets.

-   If I don't want to make any assumptions about how the data behave, how might I do that?

## Bootstrap to the rescue

-   Recall the bootstrap: we repeatedly took resamples with replacement from our original data, of same size as original data

    -   *Assuming the original data was representative*, each one of these bootstrapped data sets gives us a plausible "new" sample of data, from which we can calculate statistics of interest

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="70%"}
::: fragment
```{r}
B <- 5000
set.seed(2)
boot_means <- bootstrap_mean(n, B, prices, 2)
p1 <- data.frame(means = boot_means) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = means)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Mean housing prices ($10k)", title = "Bootstrap distribution")  +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 24))
p1

## Bootstrap to null distribution

::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r fig.height=8}
p1 + 
  geom_vline(xintercept = xbar, col = "pink", size = 2) +
  labs(caption = "Vertical line = original sample mean") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 28))
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   This is **not** the null distribution! The null distribution should be centered at $\mu_{0} = 50$.

-   However, the null distribution should have the same variability in $\bar{x}$ as the bootstrap distribution.
:::
:::::

-   So to get the null distribution, why not just **shift** the bootstrap distribution to be centered where we want it to be?

## Shifting to the bootstrap distribution

-   In this example, bootstrap distribution is centered at $\bar{x} = `r xbar`$

-   In order to center this distribution at $\mu_{0} = 50$, just subtract $`r xbar` - 50 = `r xbar - 50`$ from every single bootstrapped mean

    -   This will give us a simulated distribution for $\bar{x}$ centered at $\mu_{0} = 50$, which is exactly the null distribution!

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        We call this "shifting the bootstrap distribution", because we simply shift where the bootstrap distribution is centered
        :::

## Null distribution

```{r}
mu0 <- 50
shift <- xbar - mu0
null_dist <- boot_means - shift
null_dist_df <- data.frame(means = null_dist) |>
  mutate(extreme = (means >= mu0 + shift) | (means <= mu0 - shift)  )
p2 <-  null_dist_df |>
  ggplot(aes(x = means)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Mean housing prices ($10k)", title = "Null distribution")  +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 24))
library(patchwork)
p1 + p2
```

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    Notice where the distributions are centered
    :::

## Obtain the p-value

$H_{0}$: $\mu = 50$ versus $H_{A}$: $\mu \neq 50$

Our observed sample mean housing price is `r xbar`.

```{r}
p2
```

::: discuss
What does it mean to be "as or more extreme" now?
:::

## Two-sided alternative hypothesis

-   This is the first time we've seen a *two-sided* hypothesis

-   Since the alternative is "double sided", we can be extreme in **both** the positive and negative direction!

::: fragment
```{r fig.height=4}
p2 +
  geom_vline(xintercept = xbar, col = "magenta", size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mu0 - shift,  col = "magenta", size = 2)
```
:::

## Obtain the p-value (cont.)

Let $d$ represent the amount we shifted the distribution by:

$$d = `r xbar` - 50 = `r xbar - 50`$$

Simulated means as or more extreme than $\mu_{0} + d$ and $\mu_{0} -d$ will contribute:

  ggplot(aes(x = means, fill = extreme)) +
  geom_histogram(col = "white", binwidth = 1, center = 0.5) +
  labs(title = "Null distribution", x = "Mean housing prices ($10k)")  +
  theme_minimal()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 28)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey30", "magenta")) +
  guides(fill = "none")

p_val <- mean(null_dist_df$extreme)
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   `r sum(null_dist_df$extreme)` out of `r B` simulated sample means are as or more extreme than the observed $\bar{x}$

-   p-value $\approx `r p_val`$
:::

## Make decision and conclusion

::: discuss
Make a decision and conclusion in the context of the research question.
:::

-   Since our p-value of `r p_val` is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject $H_{0}$. We have convincing evidence to suggest that the true average housing price of homes in Duke Forest in 2020 was not \$50k.

## Comprehension questions

-   Why did we shift the bootstrap distribution?

-   How do we estimate the p-value in the case of a two-sided alternative hypothesis?
