# Key terminology

## Population and samples

-   Data do not come from thin air! Data have to be *collected* in some way.

-   This usually takes the form of sampling a subset of individuals from a target group of interest

    -   The target group of interest is called the **population**
    -   The subset of individuals from whom we actually collect data is the **sample**

-   A **case** is a fancy term for saying one observational unit

-   ::: discuss
    What are the target populations in the following research questions? What would an individual case be?

    1.  What is the average height of trees on Middlebury College campus?

    2.  What proportion of current Middlebury professors attended a liberal arts college?

    3.  Over the last five years, what is the average time to complete a degree for Middlebury College students?
    :::

## Population and samples (cont.)

-   Typically, the size of the sample is way smaller than the population. Why?
    -   In the lucky event that we are able to collect data for every individual in the population, the sample is referred to as a **census**
-   Example: the U.S. Census Bureau is responsible for producing data about the American people and economy. They collect data with different schemes and frequency:
    -   [Decennial census](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html)
    -   [American community survey](https://www.census.gov/history/www/programs/demographic/american_community_survey.html#:~:text=The%20survey%20provides%20current%20data,than%20once%20every%20five%20years.)

## Parameters and statistics

-   Often times, answering the research question simplifies to understanding a numerical summary.

    -   A numerical summary calculated from (or considered for calculation from) the entire population is called a (population) **parameter**

    -   In contrast, a numerical summary calculated from the sample is called a (sample) **statistic**

-   Why do we differentiate? It's always good to remember that we are trying to answer questions about the population!

# Sampling from a population

## A "good" sample

-   The way we sample data from a population can directly influence the quality of that sample.

-   ::: discuss
    What are desirable characteristics of a sample?
    :::

    -   **Representative**: the sample roughly "looks like" the population, i.e. the individuals in the sample offer a good representation of the population at large
    -   **Generalizable**: any results based on the sample can generalize to the population, i.e. we can make "good guesses" about a population parameter using a sample statistic
    -   **Unbiased**: every individual in the sample had an equal chance of being sampled

## Bias in a sample

-   Bias in a sample can arise due to many causes. Here are a few:
    -   Convenience sampling bias
    -   Response bias
    -   Self-selection and/or non-response bias
    -   Exclusion or undercoverage bias
    -   Survivorship bias
-   **Randomly sampling** from the population can help reduce bias in our sample.
-   Depending on the population, we might need to use different random sampling methods to ensure the sample is representative.

## Simple random sampling

-   The most intuitive and basic form of random sampling!

-   Each individual is chosen entirely by chance from the population, each member of the population has an equal chance of being sampled.

    -   Knowing that an individual was sampled does not provide useful information about which other cases are included
    -   Any given fixed-size subset of the population is equally likely to be chosen.

-   ::: discuss
    Consider again the research question: What proportion of current Middlebury professors attended a liberal arts college?

    How might I obtain a sample random sample of 25 professors?
    :::

## Stratified sampling

-   Assume that the population is/can be broken up into several different, distinct sub-populations or **strata**

    -   The division should "make sense"

-   Rather than randomly sampling from the population as whole, we take a random sample from *each stratum*

    -   How many from each stratum? Typically use a sampling fraction that is proportional to entire population!

    -   E.g. if population of trees on Middlebury campus are 80% deciduous and 20% coniferous and we want to sample $n = 10$ trees total, we should *randomly* sample \_\_\_ deciduous and \_\_\_ coniferous trees

-   May be useful to ensure we have samples from rare groups, and helps to improve precision of the sample

## Cluster sampling

-   Divide total population into $M$ distinct groups or **clusters** of roughly equal size

-   Perform a simple random sample on the $M$ clusters, than sample all individuals within each of the randomly selected clusters

-   ::: discuss
    Discuss the following:

    -   Would you prefer the individuals within a cluster to be homogeneous (similar) or heterogeneous (varied)? Why?

    -   Would you prefer that cluster A and cluster B be relatively similar or different in terms of their sub-populations?

    -   What is the difference between stratified and cluster sampling?
    :::

## Multistage sampling

-   Builds on the cluster sampling method, but rather than sampling all individuals within the selected clusters, only collect a random sample within each selected cluster

-   Though seemingly more complicated, why might we prefer multistage sampling over cluster sampling?

# Experiments vs. Observational studies

We now know *how* to collect data, but now we turn to examining *what* *kind* of study we'd like to perform in order to answer the research question. We begin with experiments. But first...

::: discuss
What is a variable?
:::

## Explanatory vs. Response

-   Lots of scientific questions revolve around asking how $x$ relates to $y$

-   If $y$ is the primary variable of interest, i.e. the variable whose behavior we want to understand, it is called the **response variable**

-   If we try to understand how changing $x$ affects $y$, then $x$ is called the **explanatory variable**

    -   Explanatory variables can often be manipulated/controlled/observed by the researcher ahead of time

## Experimental design

-   **Experiments** are studies where the researcher assigns treatments to cases

    -   Note: experiments are often conducted in medical settings, hence the word "treatment"

    -   ::: discuss
        Are treatments considered explanatory or response variables?
        :::

-   When the researcher *randomly* assigns the treatments, we have a **randomized experiment**

    -   Randomized experiments are critical when trying to assess the causal effect of the explanatory variable on the response variable

    -   Note: random assignment $\ne$ random sampling

## Confounding variables

-   Understanding a *causal* relationship is made difficult by **confounding** **variables**: variables that are associated with both the explanatory and response variable of interest

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        Confounders are bad!! Why?
        :::

-   Example: consider a study that seeks to examine the effect of coffee consumption on heart disease.

    -   From each person, we only collect information on the average amount of coffee they consume per day and whether or not they have heart disease.

    -   We find a positive association: more coffee $\rightarrow$ higher risk of heart disease

    -   Possible confounder: smoker status. Smokers [tend to drink more coffee](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4879503/#:~:text=Cigarette%20smoking%20is%20associated%20with,of%20coffee%20per%20day%202.) and tend to have [higher rates of heart disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7399440/) than non-smokers.

    -   So the increase in heart disease may be due to smoker status rather than caffeine intake

## Principles of experimental design

Running example: quizzes and final exam

1.  **Randomization**: randomly assign patients to treatments

    -   Helps account for variables that cannot be controlled and possible confounding variables

2.  **Controlling** for differences in the treatment: ensure that everyone follows the same protocol exactly

3.  **Replication**: the more cases we observe, the more confidence we have in the effect of the explanatory on the response

    -   Achieved by collecting a sufficiently large sample in a single study, or repeating the entire study more than once

::: fragment
These first three principles are crucial! The following is principle is desirable, but more complicated.
:::

## Principles of experimental design (cont.)

4.  **Blocking**: suppose we know ahead of time that there is/are variable(s) that could influence the response besides just the explanatory. We assign patients to their respective blocks, and than randomly assign treatments within blocks.
    -   Helps to decrease unexplained variability by accounting for **nuisance variables**: variables that affect the response variable but are not of interest for answering the scientific question
    -   Can lead to greater interpretation of results

## **Treatment vs. control**

-   Randomized experiments are the gold standard for data collection, but biases can still occur!

-   When we want to learn if the explanatory variable causes some effect in the response variable.

    -   We have a **control group** which establishes a baseline, and typically receives "zero amount" of the explanatory variable.

    -   We also have a **treatment group** which receives some "non-zero amount" of the explanatory variable

-   Example: suppose we want to test the effect of a drug that is developed to help people fall asleep.

    -   Treatment group: receives 50mg of the drug in pill form

    -   Control group: does not receive the drug at all

    -   ::: discuss
        What is a potential issue?
        :::

## Reducing bias in human experiments

-   We should make the experiment a **blind experiment** by not allowing participants to know which group they've been assigned to

    -   Give a fake treatment known as a **placebo** to those in the control group (e.g. a sugar pill that looks exactly like the actual treatment pill)

    -   Oftentimes, a placebo results in a slight but real improvement in patients. This is known as the **placebo effect**

-   Doctors and researchers involved in the study should also be blinded so they do not give preferential treatment or care to patients in certain groups.

    -   **Double-blind** experiments: both the patients and the doctors/researchers who interact with patients are unaware of who is or is not receiving the treatment

-   Question of ethics

## Observational studies

-   Studies where no treatment is explicitly applied

-   Nothing is manipulated; researchers simply record/observe without intervening

    -   ::: discuss
        How would we turn the quiz/exam score example into an observational study?
        :::

-   Typically cannot obtain causal conclusions using data from observational studies

    -   There are too many confounding variables at play in observational studies

-   But we can use these studies to identify associations or form hypotheses for future experiments!
