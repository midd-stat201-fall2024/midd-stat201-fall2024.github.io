# Welcome to the course!

## Important course information

-   Professor Becky Tang

    -   Office: Warner 214
    -   Email: btang\@middlebury.edu

-   Course website: <https://midd-stat201-fall2024.github.io/>

    -   Please bookmark this page and visit frequently!
    -   Note that both sections will use the same website

## What is this course about?

-   What is statistics? What is data science?

-   By the end of this course, you will:

    -   Produce and interpret graphical displays and numerical summaries of data
    -   Have developed confidence and some proficiency in coding in `R` (and in particular, the tidyverse syntax)
    -   Better understand the central role of randomness in designing studies and making conclusions
    -   Hopefully want to pursue another Statistics or Mathematics course!
    -   And much more...

## Necessary background

-   We assume ZERO background in statistics and data science

-   There is a large computing component, though not as much as in STAT 118

-   MATH 121 (Calculus 1) pre-req

## Recommendations

-   Takes notes! Each day's slides will be made available on the course website by 10pm the night before. I recommend either:

    -   Printing out the PDF version of slides to write notes on during class

        -   I recommend 4 or 6 slides per page (demo)

    -   Downloading PDF of slides to iPad/tablet/laptop and write notes on then using device

    -   Taking supplemental notes on paper/device

-   Re–visit notes within 24 hours of class

## Recommendations (cont.)

-   We will frequently make use of our laptops. Please bring one with enough charge to last the entire class each day we meet!

    -   **Please let me know as soon as possible if you do not have access to a laptop**

-   Try to resist the temptation to do other tasks (e.g. check email, online shop, watch shows) when your laptop is open

    -   This can be distracting to those around you

-   Keep an open mind and don't be afraid to ask for assistance or tell me to slow down!

-   Resist the temptation of using ChatGPT or other generative AI tools

## Beyoncé's albums

-   Beyoncé is one of the most famous singers of the 21st century

-   By 2023, Beyoncé had produced eight solo studio albums:

    -   *Dangerously in Love* (2003), *B'Day* (2006), *I Am... Sasha Fierce* (2008), *4* (2011), *Beyoncé* (2013), *Lemonade* (2016), *Renaissance* (2022)

    -   Popular opinion (i.e. Reddit) is that *Lemonade* is her best album

-   Is there any difference between the first four albums and *Lemonade*?

-   Let's consider the *average* length of words in these albums

    -   We will discuss "average" in more detail next week, but for today, we will treat "average" as a number that is calculated by summing a bunch of quantities together and dividing by the total number of quantities

## Average word length

```{r echo = F}
words <- beyonce |>
  unnest_tokens(output = word_all, input = lyric) |>
  mutate(word = str_replace_all(word_all, "[[:punct:]]", ""))  |>
  mutate(length = str_length(word)) |>
  # anti_join(stop_words) |>
  select(album, year, line, track_title, word, length) 
avg_length_true <- words |>
  filter(year < 2018) |>
  # group_by(album, year) |>
  summarise(avg_length = mean(length))
avg_length_lemonade_true <- words |>
  filter(album =="Lemonade") |>
  # group_by(album, year) |>
  summarise(avg_length = mean(length))
```

The average length of a word in Beyoncé's first four alums is `r round(avg_length_true, 2)`. What is the average length of a word in *Lemonade*?
