    -   Wednesday 4-5pm

    -   Friday: cancelled, moved to next week before midterm

## Recap

-   Learned how to interpret slope and intercept of fitted model
    -   $b_0$ is expected value of response when $x=0$
    -   $b_{1}$ is expected change in $y$ for a one unit increase in $x$
-   When explanatory $x$ is categorical, we have a slightly more nuanced interpretation
-   Coefficient of determination $R^2$ assesses strength of linear model fit

## Variability of coefficient estimates

-   Remember, a linear regression is fit using a sample of data

-   Different samples from the same population will yield *different* point estimates of $(b_{0}, b_{1})$

    -   I will generate 30 data points under the following model: $y = 1 + 0.5x+\epsilon$

        -   How? Randomly generate some $x$ and $\epsilon$ values and then plug into model to get corresponding $y$

    -   Fit SLR to these $(x,y)$ data, and obtain estimates $(b_{0}, b_{1})$

    -   Repeat this 50 times

## Variability of coefficient estimates

```{r}
set.seed(2)
n <- 30
B <- 50
beta0 <- 1
beta1 <- 0.5
b_mat <- matrix(NA, nrow = B, ncol = 2)
for(i in 1:B){
  x <-  rnorm(n)
  y <- beta0 + beta1 *x + rnorm(n,0,0.5)
  b_mat[i,] <- coef(lm(y~x))
}
p1 <- data.frame(b_mat) |>
  rename("b0" = 1, "b1" = 2) |>
  ggplot() +
  xlim(c(-2,2)) +
  ylim(c(-2,3))+
  labs(x = "x", y = "y", title = "Fitted/estimated lines", subtitle= "From 50 simulations", caption = "Pink = line using true intercept and slope")+
  geom_abline(mapping = aes(slope = b1, intercept = b0), col = "grey") +
  geom_abline(slope = beta1, intercept =  beta0, col = "pink",linewidth = 2 ) +
  plot_theme

p2<- data.frame(b_mat) |>
  rename("b0" = 1, "b1" = 2) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 1:2, names_to = "coefficient", values_to = "estimate") |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 13) +
  geom_vline(data = data.frame(estimate = c(beta0, beta1), coefficient = c("b0", "b1")), mapping = aes(xintercept = estimate),
             col = "pink", linewidth = 2) +
  facet_wrap(~coefficient, scales = "free") +
  plot_theme +
  labs(title = "Sampling distribution")
p1 + p2

```

## What are we interested in?

Remember: we fit SLR to understand how $x$ is (linearly) related to $y$:

$$
y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x + \epsilon
$$

-   ::: discuss
    What would a value of $\beta_{1} = 0$ mean?
    :::

    -   If $\beta_{1} = 0$, then the effect of $x$ disappears and there is in fact no linear relationship between $x$ and $y$

-   We don't know $\beta_{1}$, so let's look at estimate $b_{1}$:

    -   ::: discuss
        Is an estimate of $b_{1}= 0$ a convincing evidence of no relationship? What if $b_{1} = 0.1$?
        :::

    -   It depends! We saw that $b_{1}$ varies by sample! So let's perform inference for $\beta_{1}$

# Inference for SLR

Using mathematical model, not simulation!

## Running example: `evals` data

Data on 463 courses at UT Austin were obtained to answer the question: "What factors explain differences in instructor teaching evaluation scores?"

-   One hypothesis was that more attractive instructors receive better teaching evaluations

-   We will look at the variables:

    -   `score`: course instructor's average teaching score, where average is calculated from all students in that course. Scores ranged from 1-5, with 1 being lowest.

    -   `bty_avg`: course instructor's average "beauty" score, where average is calculated from six student evaluations of "beauty". Scores ranged from 1-10, with 1 being lowest.

## Teaching evaluations data

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(evals, mapping = aes(x = bty_avg, y = score)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Average beauty score", "Average rating", title = "Relationship between teaching and beauty scores")+
  plot_theme +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
p1 
```

::: discuss
Does this line really have a non-zero slope?
:::

## Hypothesis test for slope

-   We have the following hypotheses:

    -   $H_{0}: \beta_{1} = 0$: the true linear model has slope zero

    -   $H_{A}: \beta_{1} \neq 0$: the true linear model has a non-zero slope. An instructor's average beauty score is predictive of their average teaching evaluation score.

-   To assess, we do what we usually do:

    -   Check if methods are appropriate

    -   If so: obtain an estimate, identify/estimate standard error of the estimate, find an appropriate test statistic, and calculate p-value

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    The output from `lm()` actually does all of this for us, but we will see how the test statistic and p-value are calculated!
    :::

## Teaching evaluations: model assessment

We fit the model in `R`, and obtain the following plots.

::: discuss
Are all conditions of LINE met?
:::

```{r echo = F}
eval_mod <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)
tidy_eval <- eval_mod |>
  tidy()
est <- tidy_eval|>
  filter(term == "bty_avg") |>
  pull(estimate)
se <- tidy_eval|>
  filter(term == "bty_avg") |>
  pull(std.error)
test_stat <- tidy_eval|>
  filter(term == "bty_avg") |>
  pull(statistic)
n <- nrow(evals)
df <- n -2
p_val <- 2*(1-pt(test_stat,df))
```

```{r fig.width=12}
p2 <- eval_mod |>
  augment() |>
    mutate(.resid = -1*.resid) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = .resid)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 25) +
  labs(x = "Residual")+
  plot_theme

p3 <- eval_mod |>
  augment() |>
  mutate(.resid = -1*.resid) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bty_avg, y= .resid)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(y = "Residual", x = "Average beauty score") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed") +
  plot_theme

p1 + p2 + p3
```

## Looking at `lm()` output

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
library(broom)
eval_mod <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)
eval_mod |>
  tidy()
```

```{r}
tidy_eval |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 24)
```

::: discuss
Assuming the linear model is appropriate, interpret the coefficients!
:::

-   Intercept: an instructor with an average beauty score of 0 would be expected to have an average evaluation score of `r round(coef(eval_mod)[1], 3)`

-   Slope: for every one point increase in average beauty score an instructor receives, their evaluation score is expected to incrase by `r round(coef(eval_mod)[2], 3)` points

## Looking at `lm()` output

```{r}
tidy_eval |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 24)
```

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `estimate`: the observed point estimate ($b_{0}$ or $b_{1}$)

-   `std.error`: the estimated standard error of the estimate
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   `statistic`: the value of the test statistic

-   `p.value`: p-value associated with the *two-sided alternative* $H_{A}: \beta_{1} \neq 0$
:::
:::::

-   Let's confirm the test statistic calculation:

::: fragment
$$
t = \frac{\text{observed} - \text{null}}{\text{SE}_{0}} =\frac{b_{1,obs} - \beta_{1, 0}}{\widehat{\text{SE}}_{0}} = \frac{`r est` - 0}{`r se`} = `r test_stat` \sim t_{df}
$$

where $df = n-2$
:::

## p-value and conclusion

```{r}
tidy_eval |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 24)
```

Let's confirm the p-value calculation:

$$\text{p-value} = \text{Pr}(T \geq 4.09) + \text{Pr}(T \leq -4.09)$$ where $T \sim t_{`r df`}$

-   So our p-value is: `2 * (1 - pt(4.09, 461))` = `r p_val`

-   **Assuming the LINE conditions are met**: since our p-value `r p_val` is extremely small, we would reject $H_{0}$ at any reasonable significant level. Thus, the data provide convincing evidence that there is a linear relationship between instructor's beauty score and evaluation score.

## Different $H_{A}$

```{r}
tidy_eval |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 24)
```

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: discuss
What would your p-value be if your alternative was $H_{A}: \beta_{1} > 0$? What would your conclusion be?
:::

-   $\text{Pr}(T \geq `r round(test_stat, 3)`)$ = `(1-pt(4.09, 461)` = `r p_val/2`

-   The data provide convincing evidence that there is a *positive* relationship between instructor's beauty score and evaluation score.
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: discuss
What would your p-value be if your alternative was $H_{A}: \beta_{1} < 0$? What would your conclusion be?
:::

-   $\text{Pr}(T \leq `r round(test_stat, 3)`)$ = `pt(4.09, 461)` = `r pt(4.09, 461)`

-   The data do *not* provide convincing evidence that there is a *negative* relationship between instructor's beauty score and evaluation score.
::::
:::::::

## Confidence intervals

```{r}
cv <- qt(0.975, df)
ub <- round(est + (cv * se ) , 3)
lb <- round(est - (cv * se ) , 3)

tidy_eval |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)
```

We can also construct confidence intervals using the output from `lm()`! Remember:

$$
\text{CI} = \text{point est.} \pm \text{critical value} \times \text{SE}
$$

-   Critical value also comes from $t_{n-2}$ distribution

-   Suppose we want a 95% confidence intervals for $\beta_{1}$:

    -   ::: discuss
        What code would you use to obtain critical value?
        :::

    -   `` qt(0.975, `r df`) `` = `r round(cv, 2)`

-   So our 95% CI for $\beta_{1}$ is: $`r round(est, 3)` \pm `r round(cv, 2)` \times `r round(se, 3)` = (`r lb`, `r ub`)$

## Remarks

-   Note: for $\beta_{1}$, the null hypothesis is **always** of the form $H_{0}: \beta_{1} = 0$

-   LINE conditions must be met for underlying mathematical and probability theory to hold here! If not met, simulation-based methods would be a better choice

-   Here, the **I**ndependence conditions did not seem to be met

    -   Take STAT 412 or other course to learn how to incorporate dependencies between observations!

-   **So what can we say**?

    -   The results suggested by our inference should be viewed as preliminary, and not conclusive

    -   Further investigation is certainly warranted!

    -   Checking LINE can be very subjective, but that's how real-world analysis will be!
