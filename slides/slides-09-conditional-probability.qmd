## Recap

-   Two events are disjoint/mutually exclusive if they do not have any overlapping outcomes

-   Addition rule: $\text{Pr}(A \cup B) =$

-   Complement rule: $\text{Pr}(A^c) =$

## Probabilities with contingency tables

-   As we saw in the previous class, sometimes the probabilities of events are quite clear to calculate (e.g. dice rolls or drawing cards)

-   But oftentimes we have to use data to try and estimate probabilities

    -   Why? Some probabilities are not known, and we use proportions from data as a proxy

-   When we have two (or more) variables, we often want to understand the relationships between them (e.g. $A \cap B$)

Define events $A$ = died and $B$ = non-coffee drinker. Calculate/set-up the calculations for the following for a randomly selected person in the cohort:

-   $\text{P}(A)$

-   $\text{P}(A \cap B)$

-   $\text{P}(A \cup B^c)$

# Three types of probability

## Marginal and joint probabilities

1.  $\text{P}(A)$ is an example of a **marginal probability**, which is a probability involving a single event

    -   From the contingency table, we use row totals or column totals and the overall total to obtain marginal probabilities

2.  $\text{P}(A \cap B)$ and $\text{P}(A \cup B^c)$ are examples of a **joint probability**, which is a probability involving two or more events that have yet to occur

    -   From the contingency table, we use specific cells and the overall total to obtain joint probabilities

## Law of Total Probability

-   Let $A$ be an event, then let $\{B_{1},B_{2},\ldots, B_{k}\}$ be a set of mutually exclusive events whose union comprises their entire sample space $S$

-   Then **Law of Total Probability (LoTP)** says:

::: fragment
$$
\text{Pr}(A) = \text{Pr}(A \cap B_{1} ) + \text{Pr}(A \cap B_{2}) + \ldots + \text{Pr}(A \cap B_{k})
$$

## Marginal from joint

Using LoTP, we can obtain the marginal probabilities from joint probabilities (which some of you intuitively did)!

|                                | Did not die | Died | **Total** |
|--------------------------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Does not drink coffee**      | 5438        | 1039 | 6477      |
| **Drinks coffee occasionally** | 29712       | 4440 | 34152     |
| **Drinks coffee regularly**    | 24934       | 3601 | 28535     |
| **Total**                      | 60084       | 9080 | 69164     |

$$\begin{align*}
\text{P}(B) &=\text{P}(\text{no coffee}) \\
&\overset{\text{LoTP}}{=} \text{P}(\text{no coffee} \ \cap \text{ did not die}) + \text{P}(\text{no coffee} \ \cap \text{ died})  \\
&= \text{P}(B \cap A) + \text{P}(B \cap A^c) \\
&= \frac{5438}{69164 } + \frac{1039}{69164} \\
&= 0.0936
\end{align*}

## Conditional probability

3.  **Conditional probability:** a probability that an event will occur *given* that another event has already occurred
    -   E.g. Given that it rained yesterday, what is the probability that it will rain today?
    -   It is called "conditional" because we calculate a probability under a specific condition

-   $\text{Pr}(A | B)$ : probability of $A$ given $B$
    -   Not to be confused with the coding `|` which is "or"
    -   Appears to involve two events, but we assume that the event that is conditioned on (in this case $B$) *has already happened*
-   We can easily obtain conditional probabilities from contingency tables!

## Conditional probability with contingency tables

|                                | Did not die | Died | **Total** |
|--------------------------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| **Does not drink coffee**      | 5438        | 1039 | 6477      |
| **Drinks coffee occasionally** | 29712       | 4440 | 34152     |
| **Drinks coffee regularly**    | 24934       | 3601 | 28535     |
| **Total**                      | 60084       | 9080 | 69164     |

-   From contingency table, we use specific cells and row or column totals to obtain conditional probabilities

:::: fragment
::: discuss
Recall events $A$ = died and $B$ = non-coffee drinker. Write $\text{P}()$ notation for the conditional probability of dying given that someone does not drink coffee, and then obtain this probability.

## General multiplication rule

Conditional, joint, and marginal probabilities are related via the **general multiplication rule**:

::: fragment
$$
\text{P}(A \cap B) =
$$
:::

-   Let's see this in the coffee example!

-   Very useful for finding probability that two events will happen in sequence.

    -   Example: A box has three tickets, colored red, orange, yellow. We will draw two tickets randomly one-at-a-time without replacement. What is the probability of drawing the red ticket first and then the orange ticket?

## Independence and conditional probabilities

-   Recall, events $A$ and $B$ are independent when what is true about their joint probability?

-   Using the general multiplication rule, what is another way to determine if events $A$ and $B$ are independent?

    -   Why does this make sense "intuitively"?

-   ::: discuss
    Using this new test of independence, are dying and abstaining from coffee independent events?
    :::

## Conditional probability formula

We can re-arrange the general multiplication formula to obtain the following general formula for conditional probability. For any events $A$ and $B$:

::: fragment
$$
\text{P}(A| B) = \frac{\text{P}(A \cap B)}{\text{P}(B)}
$$
:::

-   ::: discuss
    Come up with a similar formula for $\text{P}(B|A)$
    :::

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    Note: complement rule holds for conditional probabilities if we condition on the *same* information: $\text{P}(A|B) = 1 - \text{P}(A^c | B)$
    :::

## Tree diagram

Tool to organize outcomes and probabilities around the structure of the data. Useful when outcomes occur sequentially, and outcomes are conditioned on predecessors. Let's do an example:

-   A class has a midterm and a final exam. 13% of students earned an A on the midterm. Of those students who earned an A on the midterm, 47% received and A on the final. Of those student who earned below an A on the midterm, 11% received an A on the final. You randomly pick up a final exam and notice the student received an A. What is the probability that they earned an A on the midterm?

-   ::: discuss
    Using $\text{P}()$ notation, what probability are we interested in? What probabilities do we need to calculate along the way?
    :::

-   Let's construct our tree!

-   ::: discuss
    In the tree diagram, where are the three types of probabilities appearing?

# Bayes' Rule

## Bayes' Rule

-   As we saw before, the two conditional probabilities $P(A|B)$ and $P(B|A)$ are not the same. But are they related in some way?

-   **Bayes' rule**:

::: fragment
$$
\text{P}(A|B) =
$$
:::

-   Why is this seemingly more complicated formula useful?

## Bayes' Theorem (more general)

-   Suppose we have a random process and have a defined event $A$

-   Further suppose we can break up the sample space into $k$ disjoint/mutually exclusive outcomes or events $B_{1}, B_{2}, \ldots, B_{k}$

-   Without loss of generality, suppose we want $\text{P}(B_{1} | A)$

-   **Bayes' Theorem** states:

    $$\begin{align*}
    \text{P}(B_{1} |  A ) &= \frac{\text{P}(A|B_{1}) \text{P}(B_{1})}{\text{P}(A)}\qquad \qquad\qquad \qquad \text{(Bayes' Rule)} \\
    &= \frac{\text{P}(A|B_{1})\text{P}(B_{1})}{\text{P}(A\cap B_{1}) + \text{P}(A \cap B_{2}) + \ldots + \text{P}(A \cap B_{k})} \qquad \qquad \text{(LoTP)} \\
    &=\frac{\text{P}(A|B_{1}) \text{P}(B_{1})}{\text{P}(A|B_{1}) \text{P}(B_{1}) + \text{P}(A | B_{2}) \text{P}(B_{2}) + \ldots + \text{P}(A | B_{k} ) \text{P}(B_{k})}
    \end{align*}$$

::: notes
How would this change if we wanted $P(A_{2} | B)$ instead?

Why is this important? We want P(B_i \| A), but sometimes we only have probabilities in the other order of conditioning!

## Example

-   In Canada, about 0.35% of women over 40 will develop breast cancer in any given year. A common screening test for cancer is the mammogram, but this test is not perfect.

-   In about 11% of patients with breast cancer, the test gives a *false negative*: it indicates a woman does not have breast cancer when she does have breast cancer.

-   In about 7% of patients who do not have breast cancer, the test gives a *false positive*: it indicates these patients have breast cancer when they actually do not.

-   If we tested a random Canadian woman over 40 for breast cancer using a mammogram and the test came back positive, what is the probability that the patient actually has breast cancer?
