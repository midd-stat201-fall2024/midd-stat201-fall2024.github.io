# Probability basics

## Key terms

-   **Random process**: a situation in which the particular *outcome* is random/not known ahead of time

    -   Examples: rolling die, sports game, if a treatment is effective

-   A **sample space** $S$ is the set of all possible outcomes of the random process

    -   ::: discuss
        What are the sample spaces above for the above examples?
        :::

-   An **event** is a set of outcomes from a random process

-   A **random variable** is a function from a sample space to the real numbers

    -   Often denoted with a capitol letter like $X$ or $Y$

    -   **NOTE**: we will focus on *discrete* random variables for now

## Probability

-   For us, the **probability** of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times

    -   Probability is used to express the likelihood that some outcome or event will or will not occur

    -   Defined as a proportion

-   Let $A$ denote some outcome or event. We denote the probability of $A$ occurring as $P(A)$ or $Pr(A)$.

    -   ::: discuss
        What sorts of values can $P(A)$ take on?
        :::

-   When the sample space $S$ is discrete with a finite size, then $Pr(A) =  \frac{\text{ number of outcomes favorable to } A}{\text{ number of total outcomes possible} } = \frac{\text{ number of outcomes favorable to } A}{\text{ size of } S}$

## Example

Let the random process be the outcome from rolling a fair, six-sided die. Let $X$ be the value of the die.

-   What is $Pr(X = 1)$?

-   What is $Pr(X = 6)$?

-   What is $Pr(X = 1 \text{ or } 2 \text{ or }... \text{ or } 6)$?

-   What is $Pr(X = 1 \text{ and } 2)$?

## Operations with events

Let $A$ and $B$ be two possible events.

-   The **intersection** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted as $A \cap B$, and is the set of outcomes that belong to *both* events $A$ and $B$

-   The **union** of $A$ and $B$ is denoted as $A \cap B$, and is the set of outcomes that belong to $A$ and/or $B$

Venn diagrams for visualizing probabilities.

## Addition rule

Let $A$ and $B$ be two possible events. Then the probability that at least one will occur is:

$$
P(A \cap B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cup B)
$$

-   Example: in a standard deck of 52 cards, we have four suits (diamond, heart, club, spade) with 13 cards within each suit (1-10, Jack, Queen, King).

    -   Suppose we randomly draw one card from the shuffled deck.

    -   Let $A$ be the event that the card is a spade.

    -   Let $B$ be the event that the card is a face card (Jack, Queen or King).

    -   Find $P(A \cup B)$.

## Disjoint events

Two events are called **disjoint** or **mutually exclusive** if they cannot both happen.

-   ::: discuss
    -   If our random process is rolling a six-sided die, what are some example of disjoint events?

    -   If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, what is $P(A \cap B)$?

    -   If $A$ and $B$ are disjoint, what is $P(A \cup B)$?
    :::

## Rules of probability

## Probability distributions

When a random variable is discrete, it can be useful to discuss its **probability distribution**, which is a table of all (disjoint) outcomes and their associated probabilities.

::: discuss
-   Let $X$ be the sum of two fair, six-sided dice. What is the sample space $S$?

-   Fill out the table below to display the probability distribution of $X$:

| $X$         | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   | 7   |

## Probability distributions (cont.)

The probability distribution of a discrete random variable must satisfy the following three rules:

1.  The outcomes listed must be disjoint
2.  Each probability must be between 0 and 1 (inclusive)
3.  The probabilities must sum to 1

## Complement

-   The **complement** of an event $A$ is the set of all outcomes in $S$ that are not in $A$

    -   Denoted as $A^c$

-   Continuing the dice example, if $A$ is the event that a 1 or 2 is rolled, what is $A^c$?

-   ::: discuss
    What is $P(A \cup A^c)$? Why?
    :::

-   We can use the above to obtain the **complement rule**

-   ::: discuss
    Let our random process be the sum of two dice. What is the probability that...

    -   the sum of the dice is $not$ 6?

    -   the sum is *at least* 4?
    :::

## DeMorgan's Laws

1.  Complement of union: $(A \cup B)^c =  \ ?$
2.  Complement of intersection: $(A \cap B)^c = \ ?$

## Independence

-   Qualitatively, two processes are **independent** if knowing the outcome of one does not provide any information about the outcome of the other process

    -   (Non) Examples?

-   If $A$ and $B$ are independent events from two different and independent processes, then $Pr(A \cap B) = Pr(A) \times Pr(B)$

    -   This extends to more than two independent processes

-   More generally, if $P(A \cap B) = Pr(A) \times Pr(B)$ and $A$ and $B$ are events from the same process, then $A$ and $B$ are independent.

    -   This is known as the **multiplication rule**


## Practice

::: discuss
A Pew Research survey asked 2,373 randomly sampled registered voters their political afilliation (Republican, Democrat, or Independent) and whether or not they identify as swing voters. 35% of respondents identified as Independent, 23% identified as swing voters, and 11% identified as both.

a.  What percent of voters are Independent but not swing voters?
b.  What percent of voters are Independent or swing voters?
c.  What percent of voters are neither Independent nor swing voters?
d.  Is the event that someone is a swing voter independent of the event that someone is a political Independent?
