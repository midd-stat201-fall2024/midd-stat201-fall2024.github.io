## Grammar of data wrangling

-   Recall: data frames are objects in R that store tabular data in tidy form

-   The `dplyr` package uses the concept of functions as verbs that manipulate data frames

    -   `select()`: pick columns by name
    -   `slice()`: pick rows using indices
    -   `filters()`: pick rows matching criteria
    -   `distinct()`: filter for unique rows
    -   `mutate()`: add new variables as columns
    -   `summarise()`: reduce variables to quantitative values
    -   `group_by()`: for grouped operations based on a variable
    -   and many more!!!

## Rules of dplyr functions

1.  The first argument is *always* a data frame
2.  Subsequent argument(s) say what to do with that data frame
    i.  We connect lines to code using a *pipe* operator (see next slide)
3.  *Always* return a data frame, unless specifically told otherwise

## Pipes

-   In programming, a **pipe** is a technique for passing information from one process to another

-   In `dplyr`, the pipes are coded as `|>` (or `%>%`)

    -   Vertical bar followed by greater than sign

-   We can think about pipes as following a sequence of actions which provide a more natural and easier to read structure

-   For example: suppose that in order to get to work, I need to find my car keys, start my car, drive to work, and then park my car

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Expressed as a set of nested `R` pseudocode, this might look like:

::: fragment
```{r eval = F}
park(drive(start_car(find("car_keys")), 
           to = "work"))
```
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Expressed using pipes, this might look like:

::: fragment
```{r eval = F}
find("car_keys") |>
  start_car() |>
  drive(to = "work") |>
  park
```

## Logical operators in R

It is common to compare two quantities using logical operators. All of these operators will return a **logical** `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

Here are list of some common operators:

-   `<`: less than

-   `<=`: less than or equal to

-   `>`: greater than

-   `>=`: greater than or equal to

-   `==`: (exactly) equal to

-   `!=`: not equal to

::: fragment
```{r echo = T, eval = T}
1 < 4
2 == 3

```
:::

## Logical operators (cont.)

We might also want to know if a certain quantity "behaves" a certain way. The following also return logical outputs:

-   `is.na(x)`: test if `x` is `NA`

-   `x %in% y`: test if `x` is in `y`

-   `!x`: not `x`



```{r echo = T, eval = T}
is.na("apple")
3 %in% 1:10
!TRUE
```


## Live code

Data from Kaggle: In 2017, Kaggle conducted an [industry-wide survey](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017/) to establish a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. We will be looking at just a subset of the data.

-   Copy and paste the following code into a code chunk in your live code! 
-   We will load in the data together and take a quick look at it before diving into data wrangling


## Piping to ggplot

-   Remember that when creating plots, the `ggplot()` function expect a data frame as its first argument

-   We may sometimes need to wrangle data prior to visualizing it. We have two options (both have pros and cons)

    1.  Wrangle the data, store the resulting data frame with a new variable name, and then refer to that data frame with `ggplot()`, or

        ::: fragment
        ```{r eval = F}
        df_new <- df |>
          mutate(age_months = age*12)
        ggplot(df_new, aes(x = age_months)) +
          geom_histogram()
        ```
        :::

    2.  Wrangle the data, and then directly pipe the result into `ggplot()`

        ::: fragment
        ```{r eval = F}
        df |>
          mutate(age_months = age*12) |>
          ggplot(aes(x = age_months)) +
          geom_histogram()
        ```

-   ::: discuss
    When do we use `|>` and when do we use `+` to connect lines of code?
