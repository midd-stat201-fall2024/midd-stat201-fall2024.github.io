-   Homework 6 due tonight

## Recap

-   CLT -\> sampling distribution for sample means -\> confidence intervals for populations means

-   Now we're returning to hypothesis testing!

    1.  Two sets of hypotheses (competing claims)

    2.  Collect data, calculate a statistic from the observed statistic, set significance level

    3.  Obtain p-value from the null distribution: sampling distribution assuming if $H_{0}$ were true

        -   p-value: probability of observing data as or more extreme as our own, assuming $H_{0}$ true

    4.  Make a decision

## Hypothesis testing using mathematical model

-   We learned how to conduct hypothesis tests (HTs) using simulation to obtain null distribution

-   But we can also use CLT to obtain null distribution!

-   So the only step that will "look different" is #3: how we obtain our null distribution and p-value

    -   Looks different depending on type of data

# Hypothesis test for single proportion

## 1. Define hypotheses

Want to conduct a hypothesis test about a population proportion.

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="33%"}
-   $H_{0}: p = p_{0}$

-   $H_{A}: p \neq p_{0}$ or $H_{A}: p > p_{0}$ or $H_{A}: p < p_{0}$
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
-   $H_{0}: p \geq p_{0}$

-   $H_{A}: p < p_{0}$
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
-   $H_{0}: p \leq p_{0}$

-   $H_{A}: p > p_{0}$
:::
::::::

-   Remember, $p_{0}$ is our "null hypothesized value": the population proportion if $H_{0}$ were true

## 2. Collect data, set significance

-   Obtain sample proportion $\hat{p}$

-   Set $\alpha$ significance level

## 3. Null distribution and p-value

Recall CLT for sample proportion: if we have $n$ independent binary observations that satisfy the success-failure condition, then

$$
\hat{p} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(p, \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \right)
$$

-   This is the *sampling distribution* of $\hat{p}$

-   We want the *null distribution* of $\hat{p}$: the sampling distribution under $H_{0}$

-   We should operate in a world where $H_{0}$ is true, which means we operate assuming $p =p_{0}$

-   So to use CLT, we must satisfy:

    -   Independence
    -   Success-failure condition under $H_{0}$: $np_{0} \geq 10$ and $n(1-p_{0}) \geq 10$

## 3. Null distribution and p-value (cont.)

If CLT holds and $H_{0}$ is true, then:

$$
\hat{p} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(p_{0}, \sqrt{\frac{p_{0} (1-p_{0})}{n}} \right)
$$

-   This specific Normal distribution is our null distribution!

-   We can standardize the null distribution:

$$
Z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0} (1-p_{0})}{n}}} \sim N(0,1)
$$ \## 3. Null distribution and p-value (cont.)

-   Now, let's compare our observed data to the null distribution to obtain our p-value

-   Calculate a **test statistic**: a quantity that assesses how consistent your sample data are with $H_{0}$

    -   our statistic here is $z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_{0}}{\sqrt{\frac{p_{0} (1-p_{0})}{n}}}$ where now $\hat{p}$ is coming from our observed data

        -   If $|z|$ large, then that means $\hat{p}$ is extremely unusual for $H_{0}$ -\> evidence suggesting we should reject $H_{0}$

-   We will use the test statistic along with `pnorm()` to obtain our p-value!

## Example: taste test

Some people claim that they can tell the difference between a diet soda and a regular soda in the first sip. A researcher wanting to test this claim using a hypothesis test at the 0.05 significance level.

-   He randomly sampled 80 such people.
-   He then filled 80 plain white cups with soda, half diet and half regular through random assignment, and asked each person to take one sip from their cup and identify the soda as diet or regular.
-   53 participants correctly identified the soda.

Let $p$ be the probability of correctly identifying soda type.

1.  Define hypotheses

    -   $H_{0}$: $p = 0.5$ (random chance)

    -   $H_{A}$: $p > 0.5$ (better than random chance)

    -   Note: $p_{0} = 0.5$ is our null hypothesized value!

2.  Collect data: $\hat{p} = \frac{53}{80} = r 53/80$

## Example: taste test (cont.)

3.  Obtain null distribution and p-value

    i.  Check conditions for inference satisfied
        -   independence: random sample

        -   success-failure: $np_{0} = 80(0.5) = 40 \geq 10$ and $n(1-p_{0}) = 80(0.5) = 40 \geq 10$
    ii. Null distribution: $\hat{p} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(0.5, \sqrt{\frac{0.5(1-0.5)}{80}} = 0.056 \right)$
    iii. Test statistic: $z = \frac{0.6625 - 0.5}{0.056} = 2.90$
    iv. p-value: probability of observing data as or more extreme as our assuming $H_{0}$ true

    $$\begin{align*}
    \text{Pr} \left(\hat{p} > 0.6625 | H_{0} \right) &= \text{Pr}\left(\frac{\hat{p} - 0.5}{0.056} >  \frac{0.6625 - 0.5}{0.056} | H_{0}\right) \\
    &= \text{Pr}\left(Z > z = 2.90 |H_{0} \right), \text{ where } Z \sim N(0,1)
    \end{align*}$$
