```

## Variables types

-   Variables can be broadly broken into two categories: numerical (quantitative) or categorical (qualitative)

-   **Numerical** variables take a wide range of numerical values, and it is sensible to add/subtract/do mathematical operations with those values. Two types:

    1.  **Discrete** if it can only take on finitely many numerical values within a given interval

    2.  **Continuous** if it can take on any infinitely many values within a given interval

-   Examples and non-examples?

## Example

::: discuss
Which of the following variables are numerical? Which are discrete vs. continuous?
:::

```{r}
insurance |>
  DT::datatable(options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

## Scatterplots

**Scatterplots** are *bivariate* (two-variable) visualizations that provide a case-by-case view of the data for two numerical variables

-   Each point represents the observed pair of values of variables 1 and 2 for a case in the dataset

::: fragment
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.align='center'}
insurance |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi, y = charges))+
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  ylab("Charges ($)") +
  xlab("Body mass index")  +
  plot_theme
```
:::

## Live code

-   Base R

-   ggplot

## Scatterplots (cont.)

-   How do we determine which variable to put on each axis?

-   What do scatterplots reveal about the data, and how are they useful?

-   How might we improve on this visualization?

## Dot plots

-   Dot plots are a basic visualization that show the *distribution* of a single variable. They are univariate (one-variable) scatterplots.

-   In the following, we have a dot plot of `BMI` rounded to the nearest integer.

::: fragment
```{r}
insurance |>
  mutate(bmi = round(bmi)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi))+
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 1) +
  xlab("Body mass index")  +
  ylab("Count") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = NULL) +
  plot_theme
```
:::

## Binning

-   Dot plots display the exact value for each observation. They become hard to read when the variable of interest has a wide set of values
-   We will sacrifice a bit of precision for convenience by *binning:*
    -   Segment the variable into equal-sized bins
    -   Visualize the value of each observation using its corresponding bin
-   For example, the `bmi` variable has observed values of $15.96$ through $49.6$. Consider the following bins of size 5: \[14, 18), \[18, 22), \[22, 26), ..., \[48, 52)
-   We tabulate/count up the number of observations that fall into each bin.

::: fragment
```{r}
insurance |>
  mutate(bmi_bin = case_when( bmi < 19 ~ "[15, 19)",
                    bmi >= 19 & bmi < 23 ~ "[19, 23)",
                    bmi >= 23 & bmi < 27 ~ "[23, 27)",
                    bmi >= 27 & bmi < 31 ~ "[27, 31)",
                    bmi >= 31 & bmi < 35 ~ "[31, 35)",
                    bmi >= 35 & bmi < 39 ~ "[35, 39)",
                    bmi >= 39 & bmi < 43 ~ "[39, 43)",
                    bmi >= 43 & bmi < 49 ~ "[43, 49)",
                    bmi >= 49 & bmi < 53 ~ "[49, 52)")) |>
  count(bmi_bin, name = "count")


```

## Histograms

**Histograms** are visualizations that display the binned counts as bars for each bin.

```{r}
insurance |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(breaks = seq(15, 53, 4)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(15, 50, 5)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, 10)) +
  xlab("Body mass index") +
  plot_theme
```

## Histograms (cont.)

-   Histograms provide a view of the **density** of the data (the values the data take on as well as how often)
-   Very helpful for understanding the *shape* of the data distribution
    1.  Distributions are either **symmetric** or **skewed** in a one direction
    2.  Distributions with long tails to the left are called **left-skewed**, whereas distributions with long tails to the right are **right-skewed**
-   Also helpful for identifying **modes** which are prominent peaks in the distribution
    -   Distribution may be **unimodal** (one peak), **bimodal** (two peaks), or **multimodal** (more than two peaks)
    -   Peaks need not be same height in histogram

## Histograms (cont.)

::: discuss
How would you describe the shape and modality in the following two histograms?

# Summary statistics for numerical data

Visualizations are great for understanding the distribution of the data, but it can be extremely useful to obtain more specific, quantitative information about how the data behave.

## Mean

-   By far the most common way to measure the center of the distribution of numerical data is using the **mean**, also called the **average**

-   We use the term **sample mean** when referring to the mean of sampled data, which is typically denoted as $\bar{x}$

    -   $x$ is a placeholder for the variable of interest (e.g. `BMI`, `charges`)
    -   The bar communicates that we are looking at the average

-   The (sample) mean is the sum over all the values of the variable, divided by total number of observations $n$:

::: fragment
$$\bar{x} = \frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots x_{n}}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}$$

  ggplot(aes(x = bmi)) +

  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 60, 10)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = mean(insurance$bmi), col = "orange",
             size = 3) +

-   The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is an example of a sample statistic

-   The mean over the entire population is an example of a population parameter. The **population mean** is often denoted $\mu$ (Greek letter mu)

-   The sample mean $\bar{x}$ is often used as an estimate for $\mu$ (more on this in STAT 311!)

## Example

Suppose we have obtained the following data on systolic blood pressure from patients at Porter Hospital:

$$
\boldsymbol{x} =116, 114, 112, 120, 108, 113, 123, 118, 119, 115
$$

-   Write out how you would calculate $\bar{x}$

-   Then we will use `R` to calculate the sample mean diastolic blood pressure!

## Means depend on proportions

::: discuss
-   What is the average of the following values? $\qquad 1, 4, 4$

-   If instead there were ten 1's and twenty 4's, would the average be the same?
:::

::: notes
$\bar{x} = \frac{1+4+4}{3} = 1\left(\frac{1}{3} \right) + 4\left( \frac{2}{3}\right) = \frac{9}{3} = 3$

$\bar{x} = 1\left(\frac{10}{30}\right) + 4 \left(\frac{20}{30} \right) = \frac{90}{30}  = 3$
:::

## Variability

-   We learned that the mean is a way to describe the center or "average value" of a numerical variable

-   However, at the heart of statistics is also the **variability** or spread of the distribution of the variable

-   We will work with variance and standard deviation, which describe how spread out data are *from their mean*

::: fragment
```{r fig.width=8, fig.height=3}
set.seed(10)
n <- 100
x <- seq(-5,5,0.01)
y1 <- dnorm(x, 0, 0.25)
y2 <- dnorm(x, 0, 1.25)
data.frame(x = x, data1 = y1, data2 = y2) |>
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:3, names_to = "variable", values_to = "density") %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=x, y = density)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~variable) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL)+
  geom_vline(xintercept =  0, col = "orange", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  plot_theme
```
:::

## Deviation

We return to the blood pressure data:

$$
\boldsymbol{x} = 116, 114, 112, 120, 108, 113, 123, 118, 119, 115 \qquad \qquad \qquad \bar{x} = 115.8
$$

-   We start with **deviation**, which is the distance of or difference between an observation from the (sample) mean

    -   How might we write this using statistical notation?

::: fragment
```{r}
x <- c(116, 114, 112, 120, 108, 113, 123, 118, 119, 115)
xbar <- mean(x)
data.frame(x = x, deviation = x - xbar)
```
:::

## Variance and standard deviation

-   The **sample variance** $s^2$ squares the deviations and takes an average:

    $$
    s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}
    $$

    -   Let's talk about this notation and intuition behind this formula. In particular, there are at least two things to note

-   The **sample standard deviation** $s$ is the square root of the sample variance ($s = \sqrt{s^2}$)

-   Calculate the sample variance and standard deviation for the blood pressure data

    -   By hand

    -   Using `R`

## Variance and standard deviation (cont.)

-   Like the mean, the population values for variance and standard deviation are denoted with Greek letters:

    -   $\sigma$ for population standard deviation (sigma)

    -   $\sigma^2$ for population variance

-   ::: discuss
    If the calculation of standard deviation is a more complicated quantity than the variance, why do we bother with standard deviation?
