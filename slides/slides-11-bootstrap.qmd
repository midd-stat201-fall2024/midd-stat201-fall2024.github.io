## Activity

While you're coming into the room, please take:

-   1 pink card

-   1 white card

1.  On the pink card, write down an estimate of the average number of hours of sleep you received *this past week*.

2.  On white card, write a 1 if this number you wrote down on the pink card is greater than or equal to 7, and a 0 otherwise

3.  Then bring these to Prof. Tang

# Housekeeping

-   Midterm review problems released
    -   Please also review your previous problem sets!
-   Office hours today 2-4pm and Wednesday 3-4pm
-   Midterm this Thursday in class! Bring a calculator.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, messabundance = F)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
plot_theme <- theme(text = element_text(size = 16))
set.seed(1)
admissions <- read_csv("data/ucb_admissions.csv") |>
  sample_frac()
```

## Where we are going

We are leaving the world of EDA and beginning to enter the world of inference and modeling!

-   Want to answer questions about a population, but must rely on a sample

-   Collect data from sample –\> calculate statistics

-   What can we say about the statistics?

-   Data are random! So how sure are we about our conclusions?

::: {.fragment style="color: maroon"}
Statistics starts here!

## Inference

**Statistical inference** is the process of using sample data to make conclusions about the underlying population the sample came from

-   **Estimation**: using the sample to estimate a plausible values for the unknown parameter

-   **Testing**: evaluating whether our observed sample provides evidence for or against some claim about the population

## Estimation questions

-   I want to know the true average number of hours of sleep Middlebury students get a night.

    -   Based on a sample of students, what might be a "good estimate" of the true average?

-   What proportion of Middlebury students get a night less than 7 hours?

    -   Based on a sample of students, what might be a "good estimate" of the true proportion?

-   Questions here are about population parameter

    -   All we have access to is the data $x_{1}, x_{2},\ldots, x_{n}$ from which we can calculate some statistics

## Activity

-   Target population:

-   Sampling method:

-   Population parameter:

-   Statistics we can calculate:

## Point estimate

-   $\bar{x}$ is often times a sensible estimate for $\mu$

-   $\bar{x}$ is an example of a **point estimate**: a single number used to estimate a true but unknown population parameter

    -   i.e. a point estimate is a statistic with a specific purpose

    -   Other examples include $s$ for $\sigma$, observed proportion $\hat{p}$ for true proportion $p$,

-   ::: discuss
    What are desirable characteristics of a "good" point estimate?
    :::

    -   Do we believe that $\bar{x} = \mu$ or $\hat{p} = p$?

## Variability of statistic

-   Two datasets collected under identical procedures will differ. As a result, value of the point estimate we obtain are also different

    -   Activity cont.

-   Thus, there exists the notion of a **sampling distribution** *of the statistic*: how the statistic behaves under repeated random samples obtained via the same sampling procedure

    -   The variability associated with the sampling distribution of the statistic is called the **standard error**

        -   Note: "error" $\neq$ bad

    -   This is in contrast to the standard deviation, which describes variability in the individual data points and not the statistic

-   Population distribution vs. sample distribution vs. sampling distribution

## Sampling distribution

-   Of course, sampling distribution of the statistic depends on underlying distribution of the population

-   Sometimes, we ***assume*** that the population/data have a very specific behavior, and this allows us to *exactly* define/quantify the sampling distribution

    -   We will see this in a couple of weeks

-   If we don't want to make assumptions, what do we do?

    -   Could conduct a census! That way we can answer any questions we want about the population. But that's impractical...

    -   How to obtain more samples cheaply and quickly?

# Bootstrap

Bootstrapping is a flexible method that allows us to move forward in an analysis without knowing exactly how the data were generated.

## Procedure

1.  Assume we have a sample $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ from the population. Call this sample $\vec{x}$. Note the sample size is $n$
2.  Choose a large number $B$. For $b$ in $1,2, \ldots, B$:
    i.  Resample: take a sample of size $n$ with *replacement* from $\vec{x}$. Call this set of resampled data $\vec{x}^*_{b}$
    ii. Calculate: calculate and record the statistic of interest from $\vec{x}^{*}_{b}$

::: fragment
At the end of this procedure, we will have a distribution of **resample or bootstrap statistics**
:::

## Demonstration

-   Activity cont.

-   Live code demonstration

## Why resample with replacement?

-   We want to understand the sampling error of the sampling distribution!

-   ::: discuss
    What would the bootstrap samples $\vec{x}^*_b$ look like if we sampled *without* replacement?
    :::

    -   Sampling without replacement -\> zero variation in the resampled statistics

-   Resampling with replacement will give us "new" datasets that are similar to original sample distribution but not exactly the same!

## Remarks

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    Relies on having a representative original sample!
    :::

    -   Resampling from initial sample should be roughly equivalent to sampling directly from the population

-   Requires computational tools!

    -   We need $B$ to be large enough to accurately capture variability. $B=5000$ or $B=10000$ sufficient in this class

    -   More complex problems will require larger $B$

-   Bootstrapping can fail!

-   Bootstrapping is *not* a solution to small sample sizes!!
