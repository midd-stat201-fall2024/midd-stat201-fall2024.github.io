## Where we're going today

-   We will see another kinds of hypotheses for different types of research questions

-   Hypothesis testing framework is the same, but will change how we obtain null distribution

-   Try to see the big picture

# Test of independence

## Running example: sex discrimination study

-   Note: this study considered sex as binary "male" or "female", and did not take into consideration gender identities

-   Participants in the study were 48 bank supervisors who identified as male and were attending a management institute at UNC in 1972

    -   Each supervisor was asked to assume the role of personnel director of a bank

    -   They were each given a file to judge whether the person in the file should be promoted

    -   The files were identical, except half of them indicated that the candidate was male, and the other half were indicated as female

    -   Files were randomly assigned to bank managers

Research question: Are individuals who identify their sex as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?
:::

-   ::: discuss
    What is/are the variables(s) here? What types of variables are they?
    :::

-   We need to construct hypotheses where $H_{0}$ is "status quo" and $H_{A}$ is the claim researchers have

-   $H_{0}$: the variables `sex` and `decision` are independent.

    -   i.e. any observed difference in promotion rates is due to variability

-   $H_{A}$: the variables `sex` and `decision` are *not* independent, and equally-qualified female personnel are less likely to be promoted than male personnel

## Data

For each of the 48 supervisors, the following were recorded:

-   The sex of the candidate in the file (male/female)

-   The decision (promote/not promote)

::: fragment
```{r}
sex <- c(rep("male", 24), rep('female', 24))
decision <- c(rep("promote", 21), rep("not promote", 3), rep("promote", 14), rep("not promote", 10))
discrimination <- data.frame(sex, decision) 

ct <- discrimination |>
  group_by(sex, decision) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  spread(decision, n) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(total = `not promote`+ promote)

ct <- ct |>
  rbind(c("total", colSums(ct[-1])))

ct <- ct |> 
  kable() |>
  column_spec(1, border_right = T)
ct
```
:::

-   Are we prepared to answer our research question: Are individuals who identify their sex as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?

    -   ::: div
        What evidence do we have?
        :::

## Data (cont.)

Conditional probability of getting promoted by sex:

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
discrimination |>
  count(sex, decision) |>
  group_by(sex) |>
  mutate(cond_prob = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(decision == "promote") |>
  select(-n)
```

```{r}
props <- discrimination |>
  count(sex, decision) |>
  group_by(sex) |>
  mutate(cond_prob = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(decision == "promote") |>
  select(-n)
p_f <- props |>
  filter(sex == "female") |>
  pull(cond_prob)
p_m <- props |>
  filter(sex == "male") |>
  pull(cond_prob)
props
```

-   Is the observed difference `r p_f - p_m` convincing evidence? We need to examine variability in the data, assuming $H_{0}$ true.

-   Let's set $\alpha = 0.05$

## Simulate under null

-   Simulating under $H_{0}$ means operating in a hypothetical word where `sex` and `decision` are independent.

    -   This means that knowing the `sex` of the candidate should have no bearing on the `decision` to promote or not

-   We will perform a simulation called a **randomization test** where we randomly re-assign `decision` and `sex` outcome pairs to see what would have happened if the bankers' `decision` had been independent of candidate's `sex` (i.e. if $H_{0}$ true)

## Randomization test

```{r}
ct
```

-   Write down "promote" on `r sum(decision == "promote")` cards and "not promote" on `r sum(decision == "not promote")` cards. Repeat the following:

    -   Thoroughly shuffle these `r length(decision)` cards.

    -   Deal out a stack of `r sum(sex == "male")` cards to represent males, and the remaining `r sum(sex == "female")` cards to represent females

        -   This is how we simulate independence under $H_{0}$

    -   Calculate the proportion of "promote" cards in each stack, $\hat{p}_{m, sim}$ and $\hat{p}_{f, sim}$

    -   Calculate and record the difference $\hat{p}_{f,sim} - \hat{p}_{m,sim}$ (order of difference doesn't matter so long as you are consistent)

## Randomization test (activity)

Try it!

## Randomization test (code)

Let's perform one iteration of the simulation.

```{r echo = T}
# reproducibility
set.seed(1)
n_female <- sum(discrimination$sex == "female")
n_male <- sum(discrimination$sex == "male")

# create cards
cards <- discrimination$decision

# shuffle cards
shuffled <- sample(cards)
```

```{r}
df_null <- data.frame(decision = shuffled) |>
  mutate(sex = c(rep("male", n_male), rep("female", n_female))) 

props_null <- df_null |>
  count(sex, decision) |>
  group_by(sex) |>
  mutate(cond_prob = n/sum(n)) |>
  filter(decision == "promote") |>
  pull(cond_prob)
ct_null <- df_null |>
  group_by(sex, decision) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  spread(decision, n) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(total = `not promote`+ promote)

ct_null <- ct_null |>
  rbind(c("total", colSums(ct_null[-1])))

ct_null <- ct_null |> 
  kable() |>
  column_spec(1, border_right = T)
ct_null
```

-   Under this simulation, `r props_null[1]` of females were promoted, and `r props_null[2]` of males were promoted. Simulated difference: `r props_null[1] - props_null[2]`

## Null distribution

```{r}
B <- 1000
props_diff_vec <- rep(NA, B)
n_promote <- sum(discrimination$decision == "promote")
n_not_promote <- sum(discrimination$decision == "not promote")
props_diff_vec <- ht_independence(n_promote, n_not_promote, n_female, n_male, B, 1)
```

Repeat the previous step `r B` times:

```{r fig.height=8}
null_dist <- data.frame(prop_diff = props_diff_vec)|>
  mutate(extreme = prop_diff <= (p_f - p_m))
null_dist |>
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_diff)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, center = 0.025, col = "white") +
  labs(x = "Null distribution of difference in promotion rates (female - male)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size= 20))
p_val <- mean(null_dist$extreme)
```

## Obtain p-value

Recall, the observed difference in our data was $\hat{p}_{f} - \hat{p}_{m} =$ `r p_f - p_m`.

-   p-value is probability of observing data as or more extreme than our original data, given $H_{0}$ true.

-   ::: discuss
    Where does "as or more extreme" correspond to on our plot?
    :::

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
```{r fig.height = 6.2}
null_dist |>
  ggplot(aes(x = prop_diff, fill = extreme)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05, center = 0.025, col = "white") +
  labs(x = "Null dist. of difference in promotion rates (female - male)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size= 24)) +
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey30", "magenta"))
```
:::
::::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Out of `r B` simulations under $H_{0}$, `r sum(null_dist$extreme)` resulted in a difference in promotion rates as or more extreme than our observed
-   So the p-value is `r p_val`
:::
::::::

## Making decision and conclusion

Our research question: Are individuals who identify their sex as female discriminated against in promotion decisions made by their managers who identify as male?

-   $H_{0}$: `sex` and `decision` are independent
-   $H_{A}$: `sex` and `decision` are not independent and equally-qualified female personnel are less likely to get promoted than male personnel by male supervisors
-   $\alpha = 0.05$

::: discuss
-   Interpret our p-value in context.

-   Make a decision and conclusion in response to the research question.
:::

## Making decision and conclusion (answer)

-   Assuming that `sex` and `decision` are independent, the probability of observing a difference in promotion rates as or more extreme as we did is `r p_val`.

-   Because the observed p-value of `r p_val` is less than our significant level 0.05, we reject $H_{0}$. The data provide strong evidence of sex discrimination against female candidates by the male supervisors.

    What kind of error could we have made?

# Comparing two proportions

## Running example: CPR

An experiment was conducted, consisting of two treatments on 90 patients who underwent CPR for a heart attack and subsequently went to the hospital. Each patient was randomly assigned to either:

-   treatment group: received a blood thinner

-   control group: did not receive a blood thinner

::: fragment
For each patient, the outcome recorded was whether they survived for at least 24 hours.

```{r}
ct <- cpr |>
  mutate(group = as.character(group))|>
  group_by(group, outcome) |>
  summarise(n = n()) |>
  spread(outcome, n) |>
  ungroup() |>
  mutate(total = survived + died)

ct <- ct |>
  rbind(c("total", colSums(ct[-1])))

ct <- ct |> 
  kable() |>
  column_spec(1, border_right = T)
ct
```
:::

-   ::: discuss
    What is/are the variables(s) here? What types of variables are they?
    :::

## Defining hypotheses

The researchers are interested in learning if the blood thinner treatment was effective.

::: discuss
In words, try to determine $H_{0}$ and $H_{A}$.
:::

-   Let $p_{T}$ and $p_{C}$ denote the proportion of patients who survive when receiving the thinner (Treatment) and when not receiving the treatment (Control), respectively

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Option 1

-   $H_{0}$: $p_{T} \leq p_{C}$

-   $H_{A}$: $p_{T} > p_{C}$
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Option 2 (preferred)

-   $H_{0}$: $p_{T} - p_{C} \leq 0$

-   $H_{A}$: $p_{T} - p_{C}> 0$
:::
::::
:::::::

## Collect data

Using the data, obtain the observed difference in sample proportions.

```{r}
ct
counts <- cpr |>
  count(group, outcome) 
```

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
```{r echo = T}
p_hat_c <- cpr |>
  filter(group == "control") |>
  summarise(p = mean(outcome == "survived")) |>
  pull()
p_hat_t <- cpr |>
  filter(group == "treatment") |>
  summarise(p = mean(outcome == "survived")) |>
  pull()
obs_diff <- p_hat_t - p_hat_c
```
:::
::::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   $\hat{p}_{C} = \frac{`r counts |> filter(group == "control", outcome == "survived") |> pull(n)`}{`r counts |> filter(group == "control") |> pull(n) |> sum()`} = `r p_hat_c`$

-   $\hat{p}_{T} = \frac{`r counts |> filter(group == "treatment", outcome == "survived") |> pull(n)`}{`r counts |> filter(group == "treatment") |> pull(n) |> sum()`} = `r p_hat_t`$

-   Observed difference: $\hat{p}_{T} - \hat{p}_{C} = `r obs_diff`$
:::
::::::

-   Is this "convincing evidence" that blood thinner usage after CPR is effective?

-   Set $\alpha = 0.05$

## Simulate under null

-   We will once again perform a *randomization* test to try and simulate the difference in proportions under $H_{0}$

    -   Under $H_{0}$, treatment group is no better than control group, so let's simulate assuming that outcome and treatment are independent

-   Write down `died` on `r sum(cpr$outcome == "died")` cards, and `survived` on `r sum(cpr$outcome == "survived")` cards. Then repeat several times:

    -   Shuffle cards well

    -   Deal out `r sum(cpr$group == "control")` to be Control group, and remaining `r sum(cpr$group == "treatment")` to be Treatment group

    -   Calculate proportions of survival $\hat{p}_{C, sim}$ and $\hat{p}_{T, sim}$

    -   Obtain and record the simulated difference $\hat{p}_{T, sim} - \hat{p}_{C, sim}$

## Simulate under null (code)

Live code

```{r echo = F}
set.seed(310)
n_t <- sum(cpr$group == "treatment")
n_c <- sum(cpr$group == "control")

# make my cards
cards <- cpr$outcome

B <- 1000
diff_sims <- rep(NA , B)
for(b in 1:B){
  # shuffle cards
  shuffled <- sample(cards)
  
  # deal out n_t cards to treatment group
  treat_sim <- shuffled[1:n_t]
  
  # deal out remaining n_c cards to control group
  control_sim <- shuffled[-c(1:n_t)]
  
  # calculate proportion of survival in each group
  p_t_sim <- mean(treat_sim == "survived")
  p_c_sim <- mean(control_sim == "survived")
  
  # calculate difference and store
  diff_sims[b] <- p_t_sim - p_c_sim
}

```

## Visualizing null distribution

```{r fig.height=8}
diff_prop_null <- data.frame(diffs = diff_sims) |>
  mutate(extreme = diffs >= obs_diff) 
diff_prop_null |>
  ggplot(aes(x = diffs))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.025, center = 0.0125, col = "white")+
  labs(x = "Null dist. of difference in survival rates (treat - control)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size= 24))
```

::: discuss
How would we obtain the p-value in this problem?
:::

## Calculate p-value

::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
```{r fig.height=8}
diff_prop_null |>
  ggplot(aes(x = diffs, fill = extreme))+
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.025, center = 0.0125, col = "white")+
  guides(fill = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey30", "magenta"))+
  labs(x = "Null dist. of difference in survival rates (treat - control)") +
  theme(text = element_text(size= 24))

n_extreme <- sum(diff_prop_null$extreme)
p_val <- round(mean(diff_prop_null$extreme), 3)
```
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   We observed `r n_extreme` out of `r B` simulations where the difference in proportions under $H_{0}$ was as or more extreme than our observed difference of `r obs_diff`

-   So p-value is `r p_val`
:::
:::::

## Interpret and make conclusion

The researchers are interested in learning if the blood thinner treatment was effective.

Our p-value is `r p_val` and our selected significance level was $\alpha = 0.05$.

::: discuss
-   Make a decision and conclusion about the research question in context.
:::

## Comprehension questions

-   What were the similarities and differences between:

    -   hypothesis test for independence

    -   hypothesis test for two proportions

-   How do the randomization tests today differ from the test for one proportion that we learned last class?
