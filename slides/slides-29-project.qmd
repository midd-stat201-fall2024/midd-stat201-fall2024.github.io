-   Please sit with your final project group this week!

-   Office hours + additional 1:1 meetings available

## Final report: Requirements

Review the Report components on the Project description page.

## `.Rmd` template

I have provided you with a `.Rmd` template for the final project. Feel free to add to/modify the template as your group sees fit!

-   Please ensure your `.Rmd` is in your STAT 201 folder

-   Then, have a copy of your working dataset as a .csv file located in the same STAT 201 folder

## Data file

-   **In your group, everyone should have the same file name for the data**.

-   Now modify the second code chunk in the template to read in your data:

::: fragment
![](figs/29-read-data.png){width="633"}

Note: name the variable whatever you like (i.e. not need to use `my_data`, so long as your group is consistent.
:::

-   If you prefer to use a `.xlsx` file, you will need to load the `readxl` package at the top of the document (may need to install first) and then modify the code to

::: fragment
```{r echo = T, eval = F}
my_data <- read_xlsx("data_file_name.xlsx")
```
:::

## R chunk headers

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
In `.Rmd` documents, we can control the behavior of specific code chunks by changing the settings in the chunk header:
:::

:::: {.column width="40%"}
::: fragment
![](figs/29-r-chunk-header.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::: fragment
For example, setting the option `eval = F` in the code chunk header means "do not evaluate the code in this chunk".
:::

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Code:

![](figs/29-eval_f_code.png)
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Output:

![](figs/29-eval_f_output.png)
:::
::::
:::::::

## Hiding code

We can hide code from the viewer but still have it execute using the `echo` setting.

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Code:

![](figs/29-echo_t_code.png)
:::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Output:

![](figs/29-echo_t_output.png)
:::
::::
::::::

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Code:

![](figs/29-echo_f_code.png)
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
Output:

![](figs/29-echo_f_output.png)

## Working methods

-   Collaborative working styles:

    -   Physically work together on the same `.Rmd` document

    -   Work on separate `.Rmd` documents and then share code with each other (e.g. via a Googledoc) to compile one master `.Rmd`

    -   A combination of the above two as the project comes together

-   Recommendations:

    -   Clear your environment before running new, shared code

    -   Knit often

## Cleaning your data

-   You might need to clean your data before working with it. This is probably most easily achieved within GoogleSheets or Excel rather than in `R`.

    -   E.g. a data entry is "6.4 hours" instead of 6.4, or there is inconsistent capitalization

-   Once/if your group has cleaned the data, you should replace the old data file in your STAT 201 folder with the cleaned version.
