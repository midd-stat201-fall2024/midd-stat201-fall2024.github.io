## Housekeeping

-   Office hours change this week
-   Mid-semester feedback survey results

```{r echo = F, message= F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, messabundance = F)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(kableExtra)
plot_theme <- theme(text = element_text(size = 24))

get_bootstrap <- function(x, n, B, stat){
  bootstrap_stats <- rep(NA, B)
  for(b in 1:B){
    # resample
    x_boot <- sample(x = x, size = n, replace = TRUE)
    # calculate and store bootstrap statistic
    if(stat %in% c("mean", "prop")){
      bootstrap_stats[b] <- mean(x_boot)
    }

```

## Testing

We are now entering into second branch of inference-related tasks: testing.

-   We have some "claim"/question about the target population, and we use sampled data to provide evidence for or against the claim/question.

-   Especially important in experiments where we want to learn the effect of some new drug

-   We will use the *hypothesis testing framework* to formalize the process of making decisions about research claims.

    -   Because claim is about target population, we will almost always formulate claims in terms of population parameters

    -   Then we use sample statistics to provide the evidence for/against

## Step 1: Define hypotheses

A **hypothesis test** is a statistical technique used to evaluate competing claims using data

-   We define hypotheses to translate our research question/claim into statistical notation

-   We always define two hypotheses *in context*: a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis

-   **Null hypothesis** $H_{0}$: the hypothesis that represents "business as usual"/status quo/nothing unusual or noteworthy

-   **Alternative hypothesis** $H_{A}$: claim the researchers want to demonstrate

::: fragment
It will not always be obvious what $H_{0}$ should be, but you will develop intuition for this over time!
:::

## Defining hypotheses in context

Research question: do the majority of STAT 201A/STAT 201B students get at least 7 hours of sleep?

-   Define $p$ as the true proportion of STAT 201A/STAT 201B who get at least 7 hours of sleep on average

<!-- -->

-   $H_{0}$: $p \leq 0.5$

-   $H_{A}$: $p > 0.5$

## Step 2: Collect and summarize data

Suppose I collect a sample of $n= 10$ students from each class:

```{r}
n <- 10
pop_a <- c(rep(1, 12), rep(0, 8));
x_a <- c(1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0); p_a <- mean(x_a)
pop_b <- c(rep(1,18), rep(0, 8)); 
x_b <- c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1); p_b <- mean(x_b)
```

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
In STAT 201A sample: `r sum(x_a == 1)` students received at least 7 hours of sleep, and `r sum(x_a == 0)` received less than 7 hours

-   Sample statistic: $\hat{p}$: `r round(p_a,2)`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
In STAT 201B sample: `r sum(x_b == 1)` students received at least 7 hours of sleep, and `r sum(x_b == 0)` received less than 7 hours

-   Sample statistic: $\hat{p}$: `r round(p_b, 2)`
:::
:::::

-   ::: discuss
    Are we prepared to answer our research question based on this evidence?
    :::

-   Due to variability in data and $\hat{p}$ we should ask: do the data provide ***convincing evidence*** that the majority of students get at least 7 hours of sleep?

## Step 3: Determine if we have "convincing evidence"

"Convincing evidence" for us means that it would be [highly unlikely]{.underline} to observe the data we did (or data even more extreme) ***if*** $H_{0}$ were true!

-   We will calculate a **p-value**: the probability of observing data as or more extreme than we did *assuming* $H_{0}$ true

    -   Note: p is not the same as true proportion $p$!

-   [Highly unlikely]{.underline} is vague and needs to defined by the researcher, ideally before seeing data.

    -   If we want to answer the research question with a binary yes/no, we need some threshold to compare the p-value to. This is called a **significance level** $\alpha$

    -   Common choices are $\alpha = 0.05$, $\alpha = 0.01$ (more on this later)!

-   For our example, we will choose $\alpha = 0.05$

## How to obtain p-value?

-   How to obtain this probability? It depends!

    -   Option 1: if we have assumptions about how our data behave, we can obtain this probability using theory/math (next week)

    -   Option 2: if we don't want to make assumptions, why not apply the bootstrap technique and simulate?

        -   We will call this option "simulating under $H_{0}$"

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    This is the step that requires the most "work", and what exactly you do will depend on the the type of data and the research question/claim you have
    :::

-   Remark: hypothesis tests, like confidence intervals, are not unique!

## Simulating under $H_{0}$ (step 3 cont.)

-   We have to simulate our data under the assumption that $H_{0}$ is true (recall $H_0$: $p \leq 0.5$)

-   Imagine a big bag with pink and purple slips of paper

    -   Pink = people who got at least 7 hours of sleep

    -   Purple = people who got less than 7 hours

-   What proportion of the slips in the bowl should be pink vs purple?

    -   **To simulate under** $H_{0}$, no more than 50% of the slip should be pink

        -   We want convincing evidence even in the most "borderline" case, so we will choose 50% of the slips to be pink.

## Simulating under $H_{0}$ (step 3 cont.)

-   Activity: we now replicate our original sample, this time sampling from this bag of paper slips

    -   We repeatedly take samples from the null distribution, using original sample size $n =$ `r n`

    -   For each sample, calculate the simulated proportion of pink slips, $\hat{p}_{sim}$

-   Live code?

::: fragment
```{r echo = T}
set.seed(2) # reproducibility
B <- 5000 # number of simulations to do to gather enough evidence
n <- 10 # size of our original sample
p_null_vec <- rep(NA, B) # vector to store the simulated proportions
for(b in 1:B){
  # sample() takes a random sample
  null_samp <- sample(x = c("pink", "purple"), # pink and purple slips
                      size = n, # sample of size n
                      replace = T, # tell R that my bowl has infinitely many marbles 
                      prob = c(0.5, 0.5)) # 50% of slips are pink and 50% are purple
  
  # calculate and store the proportion of pink slips in this simulation
  p_null_vec[b] <- sum(null_samp == "pink")/n
}
```
:::

## Null distribution of statistic

We can visualize the distribution of $\hat{p}_{sim}$ assuming $H_{0}$ true:

```{r}
null_dist <- data.frame(p_null = p_null_vec) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = p_null)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1,col = "white")+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +
  labs(x = "Null distribution of sample proportion") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
null_dist 
```

-   This is called the **null distribution** of the sample statistic, which is the distribution of the statistic assuming $H_{0}$ is true

-   ::: discuss
    Where is the null distribution of $\hat{p}$ centered? Why does that "make sense"?
    :::

## Comparing null to observed

Let's return to our original goal of Step 3! We need to find the **p-value**: the probability of observing data as or more extreme as ours, assuming $H_{0}$ were true.

-   Our observed data were $\hat{p} =$ `r p_a` (STAT 201A) or $\hat{p} =$ `r p_b` (STAT 201B)

-   $H_{0}$: $p \leq 0.5$ and $H_{A}$: $p > 0.5$

-   ::: discuss
    What does "as or more extreme" mean in this context?

    How can we use the null distribution to obtain this probability?
    :::

:::::: fragment
::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
null_dist +
  labs(title = "Section A",caption = "pink line = observed sample proportion") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_a, col = "pink", size = 2)
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
null_dist +
  labs(title = "Section B", caption = "pink line = observed sample proportion") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = p_b, col = "pink", size = 2)
```

## Obtain p-value (step 3 cont.)

We can directly obtain (technically estimate) the p-value using our null distribution and our observed $\hat{p}$!

:::::: fragment
::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
data.frame(p_null = p_null_vec) |>
  mutate(greater = p_null >= p_a) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = p_null, fill = greater)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1,col = "white", alpha = 0.5)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +
  labs(x = "Null distribution for sample proportion") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
  labs(title = "Section A") +
  # geom_vline(xintercept = p_a, col = "pink", size = 2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey30", "pink"))+
  guides(fill = "none")

p_val_a <- sum(p_null_vec >= p_a)/B
```

-   Out of `r B` replications, we saw `r sum(p_null_vec >= p_a)` instances of $\hat{p}_{sim} \geq \hat{p}$
-   p-value is $\frac{ `r sum(p_null_vec >= p_a)`}{`r B`} \approx$ `r round(p_val_a, 2)`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
data.frame(p_null = p_null_vec) |>
  mutate(greater = p_null >= p_b) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = p_null, fill = greater)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1,col = "white", alpha = 0.5)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.1)) +
  labs(x = "Null distribution for sample proportion") +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25)) +
  labs(title = "Section B") +
  # geom_vline(xintercept = p_b, col = "pink", size = 2) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey30", "pink"))+
  guides(fill = "none")

p_val_b <- sum(p_null_vec >= p_b)/B
```

-   Out of `r B` replications, we saw `r sum(p_null_vec >= p_b)` instances of $\hat{p}_{sim} \geq \hat{p}$
-   p-value is $\frac{ `r sum(p_null_vec >= p_b)`}{`r B`} \approx$ `r round(p_val_b, 2)`
:::
:::::
::::::

## Step 4: Interpret p-value and make decision

1.  Interpret the p-value in context

    -   ::: discuss
        Assuming $H_{0}$ true, the probability of observing a sample proportion as or more extreme as ours (`r p_a` or `r p_b`) is `r round(p_val_a, 2)` or `r round(p_val_b, 2)`
        :::

2.  Make a decision about research claim/question by comparing p-value to significance level $\alpha$

    -   If p-value $< \alpha$, we *reject* $H_{0}$ (it was highly unlikely to observe our data given our selected threshold)

    -   If p-value $\geq \alpha$, we *fail to reject* $H_{0}$ (we did not have enough evidence against the null)

        -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
            Note: we never "accept $H_{A}$"!
            :::

    -   ::: discuss
        Since our p value is greater than $\alpha = 0.05$, we fail to reject $H_{0}$. The data do not provide sufficient evidence to suggest that the majority of STAT 201A/STAT 201B students get less than 7 hours of sleep.
        :::

## Summary of testing framework

Four steps for hypothesis test:

1.  Define null and alternative hypotheses $H_{0}$ and $H_{A}$ in context
2.  Collect data and set significance level $\alpha$
3.  Obtain/estimate p-value by modeling randomness that would occur if the $H_{0}$ were true
    -   We did this using by simulating under the null distribution
4.  Interpret p-value and make a decision in context

## Errors in decision

-   In Step 4, we make a decision but it could be wrong! (Unfortunately, we will never know)

-   We always fall into one of the following four scenarios:

-   ::: discuss
    Identify which cells are good scenarios, and which are bad
    :::

## Errors in decision

![](figs/13-error_table_filled.png)

-   ::: discuss
    What kind of error could we have made in our example?
    :::

-   It is important to weight the consequences of making each type of error!

    -   We have some control in this. How?

## Comprehension questions

-   What are the similarities/differences between the bootstrap distribution of a sample statistic and the simulated null distribution?

-   Do you understand what a p-value represents, and how we obtain it from the null distribution?

-   What role does $\alpha$ play? Why is it important to set $\alpha$ early on?
