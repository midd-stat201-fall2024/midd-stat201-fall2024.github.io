## Birth weight data

Baystate Medical Center, Springfield, MA during 1986 on the birth weights of 189 babies, along with descriptive information about the mother

```{r}
library(readr)
birthwt <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midd-stat201-fall2024/midd-stat201-fall2024.github.io/refs/heads/main/data/birthwt.csv")
```

-   Want to understand risk factors for a baby's birth weight (`bwt`)

-   Homework 8 explores the effect of mother's `smoke` status on birth weight of baby

-   Let's look at a different variable: `race` of mother

    -   Variable `race` numerical where 1 = white, 2 = black, 3 = other

::: fragment
```{r}
str(birthwt)
```
:::

## Converting to factor

We need to convert variable `race` to categorical! Does not make sense to do "math" on variable:

```{r echo = T}
birthwt2 <- birthwt |>
  mutate(race = case_when(race == 1 ~ "white",
                          race == 2 ~ "black",
                          race == 3 ~ "other")) |>
  mutate(race = factor(race, levels = c("white", "black", "other")))

str(birthwt2)
```

## Fit model

```{r eval = F, echo = T}
bwt_lm <- lm(bwt ~ race, data = birthwt2)
tidy(bwt_lm)
```

```{r}
bwt_lm <- lm(bwt ~ race, data = birthwt2)
tidy(bwt_lm) |>
  kable()
bwt_coefs <- round(coef(bwt_lm), 2)
```
 
::: {.fragment}
Fitted model:

$$
\widehat{\text{birth_wt}} = `r bwt_coefs[1]`  `r bwt_coefs[2]` \text{raceBlack}  `r bwt_coefs[3]` \text{raceOther}
$$

$$\text{raceBlack} = \begin{cases}0 & \text{if race = Black}  \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases} \qquad \text{raceOther} = \begin{cases}0 & \text{if race = Other}  \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: discuss
Estimate the birth weight for babies whose mothers are White
:::

## Interpreting coefficients

$$
\widehat{\text{birth_wt}} = `r bwt_coefs[1]` + `r bwt_coefs[2]` \text{raceBlack} + `r bwt_coefs[3]` \text{raceOther}
$$

-   $\widehat{\text{birth_wt}} = `r bwt_coefs[1]`  `r bwt_coefs[2]` \times \color{orange}{0}  `r bwt_coefs[3]` \times \color{orange}{0}$

-   The estimated birth weight of babies whose mothers are White is `r bwt_coefs[1]` grams

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    More generally: $b_{0}$ is the estimated value of the response variable for the base level
    :::

-   ::: discuss
    What is the interpretation of $b_{1}$ = `r bwt_coefs[2]`? Of $b_{2}$ = `r bwt_coefs[3]`?
    :::

    -   Babies whose mothers are Black have an estimated birth weight about `r abs(bwt_coefs[2])` grams less than babies whose mothers are White

    -   Babies whose mothers are race "Other" (i.e. not Black or White) have an estimated birth weight about `r abs(bwt_coefs[3])` grams less than babies whose mothers are White

## General interpretation

```{r}
tidy(bwt_lm) |>
  kable()
```

-   When fitting a regression model with a categorical variable with $k > 2$ levels, the software will always provide a coefficient for $k-1$ of the levels

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        The base level does not receive a coefficient
        :::

    -   Interpretation of the coefficient associated with a non-base level is the expected change in the response **relative to** the base level

-   Note: the fitted model has more than one "slope" coefficient, but the `race` variable is still a single explanatory variable

-   What happens if we explicitly want to include more than one explanatory variable?

# Multiple linear regression

## Multiple linear regression

-   We have seen *simple* linear regression, where we had one explanatory variable

-   Extend to include multiple explanatory variables

    -   Seems natural: usually several factors affect behavior of phenomena

-   **Multiple linear regression** takes the form: $$y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{1} + \beta_{2} x_{2} + \ldots + \beta_{p} x_{p} + \epsilon$$

    -   Now there are $p$ different explanatory variables $x_{1},\ldots, x_{p}$ per observation

    -   Still one response $y$ and error $\epsilon$ per observation

-   Represents a holistic approach for modeling all of the variables simultaneously

## Birthweight data (cont.)

Suppose we would also like to include the mother's age (`age`) and weight at last period (`lwt`) into the model:

$$\text{birth_wt} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \text{raceBlack} + \beta_{2} \text{raceOther} + \beta_{3} \text{age} + \beta_4 \text{lwt} + \epsilon$$

-   Just as in the case of SLR, the estimates of $\beta_{0},\ldots, \beta_{4}$ parameters are chosen via the squared deviation criterion

## Multiple regression in `R`

Very easy to code:

```{r echo = T}
bwt_mlr <- lm(bwt ~ race + age + lwt, data = birthwt2)
```

```{r}
mlr_coefs <- round(coef(bwt_mlr),2)
tidy(bwt_mlr) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 20)
```


-   Simply identify the estimated coefficients from the output to obtain fitted model

::: fragment
$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\text{birth_wt}} &= `r mlr_coefs[1]`  `r mlr_coefs[2]` \text{raceBlack} `r mlr_coefs[3]` \text{raceOther} +  `r mlr_coefs[4]` \text{age}  \\
& \quad + `r mlr_coefs[5]` \text{lwt}
\end{align*}
$$
:::

-   Note that the number of explanatory variables need not equal the number of parameters in the model!

## Interpretation

-   When we have more than one predictor variable, interpretation of the coefficients requires a bit of care

    -   Multiple moving parts

-   Interpretation of a particular coefficient $b_{m}$ relies on "holding the other variables fixed/constant" (assuming the model is appropriate)

::: fragment
$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\text{birth_wt}} &= `r mlr_coefs[1]`  `r mlr_coefs[2]` \text{raceBlack} `r mlr_coefs[3]` \text{raceOther} + \color{orange}{`r mlr_coefs[4]`} \text{age}  \\
& \quad + `r mlr_coefs[5]` \text{lwt}
\end{align*}
$$
:::

-   For every one year older the mother is, the baby's birth weight is expected to increase by $\color{orange}{`r mlr_coefs[4]`}$ grams, **holding all other variables constant**

-   ::: discuss
    Interpret the coefficient associated with the mother's weight (`lwt`)
    :::

## Interpretation (cont.)

$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{\text{birth_wt}} &= `r mlr_coefs[1]`  `r mlr_coefs[2]` \text{raceBlack} `r mlr_coefs[3]` \text{raceOther} +  `r mlr_coefs[4]` \text{age}  \\
& \quad + \color{orange}{`r mlr_coefs[5]`} \text{lwt}
\end{align*}
$$

-   For every one pound heavier the mother's weight at last period was, the baby's birth weight is expected to increase by $\color{orange}{`r mlr_coefs[5]`}$ grams, holding all other variables constant


## More isn't always better

-   You might be tempted to throw in all available predictors into your model! Don't fall into temptation!

-   Quality over quantity

-   For SLR, we used the coefficient of determination $R^2$ to assess how good the model was

    -   $R^2$ is less helpful when there are many variables

    -   Why? The $R^2$ will never decrease (and will *almost* *always* increase) when we include an additional predictor

## Adjusted $R^2$

-   For multiple linear regression, we use the **adjusted** $R^2$ to assess the quality of model fit

    -   "Adjusted" for the presence of additional predictors

    -   Take STAT 211 to learn the formula and intuition behind it!

-   Adjusted $R^2$ is always less than $R^2$

## Adjusted $R^2$ (cont.)

## Conditions for inference

We still need LINE to hold

-   **Linearity**: harder to assess now that multiple predictors are involved. Good idea to make several scatter plots

-   **Independence**: same as before

-   **Nearly normal residuals**: same as before

-   **Equal variance**: residual plot has *fitted* values on the x-axis, instead of an explanatory variable

# Inference in MLR

## Hypothesis testing in MLR

-   In MLR, we are interested in the effect of a variable $m$ on the response $y$.

    -   Need to account for presence of other predictors in the model

-   $H_{0}: \beta_m = 0$, given other predictors in the model

-   $H_{A}: \beta_m \neq 0$, given other predictors in the model (or $>, <$)

-   We can write down one null hypothesis for each coefficient in the model

## Hypothesis tests from `lm()`

Returning to the larger model:

$$\text{birth_wt} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \text{raceBlack} + \beta_{2} \text{raceOther} + \beta_{3} \text{age} + \beta_4 \text{lwt} + \epsilon$$

-   We can test the following null hypotheses (no need to write down):

    -   $H_{0}: \beta_{1} = 0$, given `age` and `lwt` are included in the model
    -   $H_{0}: \beta_{2} = 0$, given `age` and `lwt` are included in the model
    -   $H_{0}: \beta_{3} = 0$, given `race` and `lwt` are included in the model
    -   $H_{0}: \beta_{4} = 0$, given `race` and `age` are included in the model

## Hypothesis tests from `lm()`

```{r}
tidy(bwt_mlr) |>
  kable(digits = 4) |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 25)
```

-   Output from `lm()` provides:

    -   Test statistic, which follows $t_{n-p}$ where $p =$ total number of unknown parameters (i.e. $\beta$ terms)

    -   p-values for testing two-sided $H_{A}$ provided

## Hypothesis tests from `lm()` (cont.)

```{r}
tidy(bwt_mlr) |>
  kable(digits = 4) |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 25)
```

-   `lwt` **does** seem to be an important predictor for birth weight, despite inclusion of `race` and `age` in the model

    -   Low p-value suggests it would be extremely unlikely to see data that produce $b_{4} =  `r mlr_coefs[5]`$ if the true relationship between `lwt`and `bwt` was non-existent (i.e., if $\beta_{4} = 0$) and the model also included `age` and `race`

-   `race` **does** seem to be an important predictor, despite inclusion of `age` and `lwt`

-   `age` **does not** seem to be an important predictor after including `race` and `lwt`

## Simpler model

Let's see the model that does not include mother's age in the model:

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
bwt_mlr_no_age <- lm(bwt ~ race + lwt, data = birthwt2)
tidy(bwt_mlr_no_age)
```

```{r}
bwt_mlr_no_age <- lm(bwt ~ race + lwt, data = birthwt2)
tidy(bwt_mlr_no_age) |>
  kable(digits = 4) |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 25)
coefs2 <- round(coef(bwt_mlr_no_age), 2)
```

::: {.fragment}
::: discuss

## Simpler model (cont.)

```{r}
tidy(bwt_mlr_no_age) |>
  kable(digits = 4) |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 25)
```

-   Intercept: the birth weight of babies whose mothers are White have an estimated birth weight of `r coefs2[1]` grams, holding all other variables (i.e. `lwt`) constant

-   Coefficient for `lwt`: for every one pound increase in the mother's weight at last period, the birth weight of the baby is expected to increase by `r coefs2[4]` grams, holding all other variables (i.e. `race`) constant

## Comparing models

Let's compare the model that includes `age` to the model without `age`:

## Remarks

-   We have only scratched the surface of MLR

-   Things to consider:

    -   Multicollinearity (when the predictor variables are correlated with each other)
    
    - Model selection
    
    - More than one categorical variable

    -   Interaction effects
