## Housekeeping

-   Office hours 3-4pm
-   Midterm tomorrows! Bring a calculator.

```{r echo = F, message= F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F, warning = F, messabundance = F)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
plot_theme <- theme(text = element_text(size = 24))

get_bootstrap <- function(x, n, B, stat){
  bootstrap_stats <- rep(NA, B)
  for(b in 1:B){
    # resample
    x_boot <- sample(x = x, size = n, replace = TRUE)
    # calculate and store bootstrap statistic
    if(stat %in% c("mean", "prop")){
      bootstrap_stats[b] <- mean(x_boot)
    }
  }
  bootstrap_stats
}
```

## Recap

-   Sampling distribution describes how statistic behaves under repeated sampling from population
-   Let's return to the data collected from our activity.
    -   I will repeatedly take SRS of $n=10$ values from the population (call this $\vec{x}$) and calculate $\hat{p}$. Sampling distribution of $\hat{p}$ is as follows:

```{r}
set.seed(1)
pop_a <- c(rep(1, 12), rep(0, 8)); mu_a <- mean(pop_a)
pop_b <- c(rep(1,18), rep(0, 8)); mu_b <- mean(pop_b)
n <- 10
G <- 5000
prop_a <- prop_b <- rep(NA, G)
for(i in 1:G){
  prop_a[i] <- mean(sample(pop_a, n, replace = F))
  prop_b[i] <- mean(sample(pop_b, n, replace = F))
}
```

## Bootstrap recap

Taking new samples each time is costly! Bootstrap distribution is an *approximation* of the sampling distribution of the statistic!

Procedure:

1.  Assume we have a sample $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$ from the population. Call this sample $\vec{x}$. Note the sample size is $n$
2.  Choose a large number $B$. For $b$ in $1,2, \ldots, B$:
    i.  Resample: take a sample of size $n$ with *replacement* from $\vec{x}$. Call this set of resampled data $\vec{x}^*_{b}$
    ii. Calculate: calculate and record the statistic of interest from $\vec{x}^{*}_{b}$

::: fragment
At the end of this procedure, we will have a distribution of **resample or bootstrap statistics**
:::

## Bootstrap distribution from activity

```{r}
B <- 5000
```

We have the following bootstrap distribution of sample proportions, obtained from $B=$ `r B` iterations:

```{r echo = F}
# set.seed(1)
n_a <- n_b <- n
x_a <- sample(pop_a, n_a)
x_b <- sample(pop_b, n_b)
# bootstrap dist of sample means
```

-   Notice where the bootstrap distribution is centered
-   What do we do with the bootstrap distribution?

## Answering estimation question

Recall our research question: What proportion of STAT 201A/STAT 201B students get at least 7 hours of sleep a night?

-   Could respond using our single point estimate: $\hat{p}_{A} = `r mean(x_a)`$ or $\hat{p}_{B} = `r mean(x_b)`$
-   But due to variability, we recognize that the point estimate will rarely (if ever) equal population parameter
-   Rather than report a single number, why not report a range of values?
    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        This is possible only if we have a distribution to work with!!
        :::

## Confidence intervals

-   Analogy: would you rather go fishing with a single pole or a large net?

    -   A range of plausible values gives us a better chance at capturing the parameter

-   A confidence interval provides such a range of values (more rigorous definition coming soon)

    -   "Interval" = we specify a lower bound and an upper bound

    -   Confidence intervals are not unique! Depending on the method you use, you might get different intervals

## Bootstrap percentile interval

-   The $\gamma \times 100$% **bootstrap percentile interval** is obtained by finding the bounds of the middle $\gamma \times 100$% of the bootstrap distribution

    -   ::: discuss
        e.g. If I want a 90% bootstrap percentile interval, where would the bounds be?
        :::

-   Called "percentile interval" because the bounds are the $(1-\gamma)/2$ and $(1+\gamma)/2$ percentiles of the bootstrap distribution

    -   e.g. if $\gamma = 0.80$, then the bounds would be $(1-0.80)/2 = 0.10$ and $(1+0.80)/2 = 0.90$ percentiles

-   For our purposes, "bootstrap confidence interval" will be equivalent to "bootstrap percentile interval"

## Obtaining bootstrap confidence interval

```{r}
# data frame containing our bootstrap statistics
gamma <- 0.9
df_temp <- rbind(mutate(df_a, section = "Section A"),
      mutate(df_b, section = "Section B"))
bounds <- df_temp |>
  group_by(section) |>
  summarise(lb = quantile(props, (1-gamma)/2), ub = quantile(props, (1+gamma)/2)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  data.frame()

df_temp |>
  ggplot(aes(x = props)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, col = "white")+
  facet_wrap( ~ section) +
  geom_vline(data = bounds, mapping = aes(xintercept = lb), col = "orange",
             size = 2)+
  geom_vline(data = bounds, mapping = aes(xintercept = ub), col = "orange",
             size = 2)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,1,0.2)) +
  labs(caption = paste0("orange lines denote ",gamma*100, "% bootstrap CI"), x = "proportion")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 24))

```

-   Section A `r gamma*100`% confidence interval for $p_{A}$: (`r bounds[1,]$lb`, `r bounds[1,]$ub`)

-   Section B `r gamma*100`% confidence interval for $p_{B}$: (`r bounds[2,]$lb`, `r bounds[2,]$ub`)

## Interpreting a confidence interval

-   Our `r gamma*100`% confidence interval is: (`r bounds[1,]$lb`, `r bounds[1,]$ub`) or (`r bounds[2,]$lb`, `r bounds[2,]$ub`). Does this mean there is a `r gamma*100`% chance/probability that the true proportion lies in the interval?

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        Answer: NO
        :::

-   Remember: bootstrap distribution is based on our original sample

    -   If we started with a different original sample $\vec{x}$, then our estimated `r gamma*100`% confidence interval would also be different

-   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
    What a confidence interval (CI) represents: if we take many independent repeated samples from this population using the same method and calculate a $\gamma \times 100$ % CI for the parameter in the exact same way, then in theory, $\gamma \times 100$ % of these intervals should capture/contain the parameter
    :::

    -   $\gamma$ represents the long-run proportion of CIs that theoretically contain the true parameter

    -   However, we never know if any particular interval(s) actually do!

## Interpreting a confidence interval (cont.)

-   Correct interpretation (generic): We are $\gamma \times 100$ % confident that the population parameter is between the lower bound and upper bound.

    -   ::: discuss
        Interpret our bootstrap CI in context
        :::

    -   Again: why is this interpretation **incorrect**? "There is a `r gamma*100`% chance/probability that the true parameter value lies in the interval."

## Remarks

-   ::: discuss
    What is a virtue of a "good" confidence interval?
    :::

-   ::: discuss
    How do you expect the interval to change as the original sample size $n$ changes?

    How do you expect the interval to change as level of confidence $\gamma$ changes?
    :::

-   Once again, relies on a representative original sample!

## Comparing confidence intervals

Comparing changes in $\gamma \times 100$ % CI for sample sizes: $n = 5$, $n = 10$, and $n = 17$:

```{r}
n2 <- 17
n1 <- 5
df_all <- rbind(mutate(df_a, n = n_a, section = "A"), 
                mutate(df_b, n = n_b, section = "B"),
                data.frame(props = get_bootstrap(x_a, n2, B, "prop"), n = n2, section = "A"),
                data.frame(props = get_bootstrap(x_a, n1, B, "prop"), n = n1, section = "A"),
                data.frame(props = get_bootstrap(x_b, n2, B, "prop"), n = n2, section = "B"),
                data.frame(props = get_bootstrap(x_b, n1, B, "prop"), n = n1, section = "B")) |>
  mutate(n_lab = paste0("n = ", n)) |>
    mutate(n_lab = factor(n_lab, levels = paste0("n = ", sort(c(n2,n1,n_a)))))


bounds <- df_all |>
  group_by(n_lab, section) |>
  summarise(lb = quantile(props, (1-gamma)/2), ub = quantile(props, (1+gamma)/2))  |>
  ungroup() |>
  data.frame()
