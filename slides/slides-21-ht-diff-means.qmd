-   No office hours tomorrow

-   Daylight savings this weekend

-   Data collection proposal due Monday 11/4 midnight!

## Recap

-   Test for difference in two proportions

    -   Learned about $\hat{p}_{pooled}$

-   Test for a single mean

    -   $z$-test: we know $\sigma$, use standard Normal distribution

    -   $t$-test: we don't know $\sigma$, use $t$ distribution

# Hypothesis test for mean paired difference

## Paired data (recap)

-   Recall paired data: we have two set of data $\boldsymbol{x}$ and $\boldsymbol{y}$ where each $x_{i}$ has a corresponding to one $y_{i}$

    -   Can obtain differences $d_{i} = y_{i} - x_{i}$

    -   We are interested in the true mean difference $\mu_{d}$

-   Recall: if observational units are independent and the differences are approximately Normal, then CLT gives us:

::: fragment
$$
\bar{d} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\mu_{d}, \frac{\sigma_{d}}{\sqrt{n}}\right)
$$
:::

-   We don't typically know $\sigma_{d}$, so replace with sample $s_{d}$ (and then use $t$ distribution)

## Hypothesis test

-   Hypotheses: $H_0: \mu_{d} = \mu_{0}$ versus $H_{A}: \mu_{d} \neq \mu_0$ (or $>$ or $<$ )

-   Obtain summary statistics $\bar{d}_{obs}$ and $s_{d}$

-   ::: discuss
    Check if CLT holds. If so, what is our **null distribution**?
    :::

::: fragment
$$
\bar{d} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\mu_0, \frac{\sigma_{d}}{\sqrt{n}} \right)
$$
:::

-   ::: discuss
    Because we don't know $\sigma_{d}$, our **test statistic** here is:
    :::

::: fragment
$$
t = \frac{\bar{d}_{obs} - \mu_0}{\frac{s_{d}}{\sqrt{n}}} \sim t_{df}
$$

where $df = n-1$

## Example: zinc (revisited)

```{r}
zinc <- data.frame(bottom = c(0.430, 0.266, 0.567, 0.531, 0.707, 0.716, .651,	.589,	.469,	.723),
                   surface = c(.415,	.238,	.390,	.410,	.605,	.609,	.632,	.523,	.411,	.612))
```

Data consist of measured zinc concentrations in bottom water and surface water at 10 randomly sampled wells:

::: {style="color: maroon"}
Do the data suggest that the true average concentration in the bottom water is greater than that of surface water? Let's now answer this using a hypothesis test at the 0.05 level.
:::

-   ::: discuss
    Define parameters and hypotheses
    :::

    -   Let $\mu_{d}$ be the true mean difference between zinc concentrations (bottom-surface)
    -   $H_{0}: \mu_{d} = 0$ versus $H_{A}: \mu_{d} > 0$

-   Last week, we saw conditions for CLT were satisfied

## Example: zinc (cont.)

```{r echo = T}
zinc <- zinc |>
  mutate(d = bottom - surface)
d_bar <- mean(zinc$d)
d_bar
s_d <- sd(zinc$d)
s_d
```

```{r}
n <- nrow(zinc)
d_bar <- round(d_bar, 4)
s_d <- round(s_d, 3)
se <- round(s_d/sqrt(n), 3)
t <- round((d_bar - 0)/(s_d/sqrt(n)), 3)
df <- n-1
p_val <- round(1 - pt(t, df), 3)
```

::: discuss
Find the test-statistic
:::

## Example: zinc (cont.)

::: fragment
$$t = \frac{\bar{d}_{obs} - \mu_{0}}{s_{d}/\sqrt{n}} = \frac{`r d_bar` - 0}{`r s_d`/\sqrt{`r n`}} = `r t`  \sim t_{`r df`}$$
:::

-   So our p-value is $\text{Pr}(T \geq t) = \text{Pr}(T \geq `r t`) = 1 - \texttt{pt(`r t`, `r df`)} = `r p_val`$

- We reject $H_{0}$! The data provide convincing evidence that zinc concentrations of bottom well water is greater than those of surface water.

# Hypothesis test for difference in means

## Sampling distribution for difference in means

-   Two populations, interest in $\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}$ (or other order)

-   Samples of size $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$

-   If CLT holds, we learned sampling distribution of difference in sample means is:

::: fragment
$$
\bar{X}_{1} - \bar{X}_{2} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(\mu_{1} - \mu_{2}, \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}}} \right)
$$
:::

-   When we don't know the population standard deviations, we replace the $\sigma$ with $s$ and use a $t$ distribution

-   Same thing will happen for hypothesis test!

    -   ::: {style="color: maroon"}
        Same conditions for inference: independence (extended) and approximate normality/large sample size (extended)
        :::

## Hypothesis test

Hypotheses $H_{0}: \mu_{1} = \mu_{2}$ versus $H_{A}: \mu_{1} \neq \mu_{2}$ (or $>$ or $<$)

-   If CLT holds, our **null distribution** for the difference in sample means is:

::: fragment
$$
\bar{X}_{1} - \bar{X}_{2} \overset{\cdot}{\sim} N\left(0, \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{\sigma_{2}^2}{n_{2}} }\right)
$$
:::

-   ::: discuss
    In practice, use $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$. So our **test-statistic** is...
    :::

::: fragment
$$
t= \frac{\text{point est} - \text{null value} }{\widehat{\text{SE}}_{0}} = \frac{(\bar{x}_{1} - \bar{x}_{2}) - 0}{\sqrt{\frac{s_{1}^2}{n_{1}} + \frac{s_{2}^2}{n_{2}}}} \sim t_{df}
$$

where $df = \min(n_{1}-1, n_{2}-1)$
