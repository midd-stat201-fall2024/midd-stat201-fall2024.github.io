## Simulation-based HT for slope

Recall our hypotheses for the slope: $H_{0}: \beta_{1} = 0$ versus $H_{A}: \beta_{1} \neq 0$

::: discuss
How might we use simulation to test these hypotheses? (i.e. how can we simulate "null world"?)
:::

-   Under $H_{0}$, there is no relationship between $x$ and $y$, so we can shuffle/permute/break up the $(x_{i}, y_{i})$ under $H_{0}$

    -   i.e. there is no special correspondence between $x_{i}$ and $y_{i}$

## Randomization test (demonstration)

Here's how it would look like using cards. Repeat the following $B$ times:

1.  Write down all $x_1,\ldots, x_{n}$ values and all $y_{1},\ldots, y_{n}$ values on cards.

2.  Shuffle the response variable cards to get $y_{1}^{shuff}, \ldots, y_{n}^{shuff}$

3.  Deal out the shuffled responses to pair with an explanatory: $(x_{1}, y_{1}^{shuff}),\ldots, (x_{n}, y_{n}^{shuff})$

4.  Fit linear regression model to these shuffled data and record $b_{1}$

::: {style="color: maroon"}
-   Convince yourself this corresponds to $H_0: \beta_{1} = 0$!

-   We are *not* sampling with replacement
:::

## `evals`

Let's return to our `evals` data and model: $\text{score} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \text{bty_avg} + \epsilon$

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="40%"}
::: fragment
First six rows of original data:

```{r}
evals |>
  slice(1:6) |>
  select(course_id, bty_avg, score) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 28)
```
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
First six rows of one iteration of *shuffled data:*

```{r}
set.seed(1)
evals |>
  mutate(score_shuff = sample(score)) |>
  slice(1:6) |>
  select(course_id, bty_avg, score, score_shuff) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 28)
```
:::
::::
:::::::

## Your turn!!

$$\text{score} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} \text{bty_avg} + \epsilon$$

In groups, obtain the null distribution for this $H_{0}$ via simulation and visualize it using `ggplot` with **informative** title and axis labels. (You could be expected to do something like this for your midterm...)

-   Suggestion: in a ***relevant*** place in your code, use the data frame `evals` to create a new data frame called `evals_null`

    -   `evals_null` should have a variable called `score_shuffle` that represents the shuffled `score`s

## `evals` null distribution

$H_{0}: \beta_{1} = 0$ (there is no linear relationship between `score` and `bty_avg`)

$H_{A}: \beta_{1} > 0$ (there is a positive linear relationship between `score` and `bty_avg`)

::: fragment
```{r}
set.seed(116)
B <- 1000
b1_null <- rep(NA, B)
for(b in 1:B){
  evals_null <- evals |>
    mutate(score_shuffle = sample(score, replace = F))
  null_lm <- lm(score_shuffle ~ bty_avg, data = evals_null)
  b1_null[b] <- coef(null_lm)[2]
}

p_null <- data.frame(b1 = b1_null) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = b1)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "white") +
  plot_theme +
  labs(x = expression(b[1]), title = "Null distribution",
       caption= paste(B, "iterations"))
p_null
```
:::

## p-value

```{r echo = T, eval = F}
score_lm <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)
tidy(score_lm)
```

```{r echo = F, eval = T}
score_lm <- lm(score ~ bty_avg, data = evals)
tidy(score_lm) |>
  kable() |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 25)
b1_fit <- coef(score_lm)[2]

```

-   Compare our observed fitted $b_{1,obs} = `r round(b1_fit, 3)`$ coefficient to null distribution:

:::::: columns
:::: {.column width="60%"}
::: fragment
```{r}
p_null +
  geom_vline(xintercept = b1_fit, colour = "purple") +
  labs(caption = "Estimated slope")

p_val <- mean(b1_null >= b1_fit)
```
:::
::::

::: {.column width="40%"}
-   Recall: $H_{A}: \beta_{1} > 0$

-   p-value is calculated as $\frac{\text{number of simulated } b_{1} > `r round(b1_fit, 3)`}{B} = `r p_val`$
