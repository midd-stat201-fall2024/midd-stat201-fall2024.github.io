<li>Very helpful for understanding the <em>shape</em> of the data distribution
<ul>
<li>Distributions are either <strong>symmetric</strong> or <strong>skewed</strong> in a one direction</li>
<li>Distributions with long tails to the left are called <strong>left-skewed</strong>, whereas distributions with long tails to the right are <strong>right-skewed</strong></li>

<li>Also helpful for identifying <strong>modes</strong> which are prominent peaks in the distribution
<ul>
<li>Distribution may be <strong>unimodal</strong> (one peak), <strong>bimodal</strong> (two peaks), or <strong>multimodal</strong> (more than two peaks)</li>
<li>Peaks need not be same height in histogram</li>

<h1>Summary statistics for numerical data</h1>
<p>Visualizations are great for understanding the distribution of the data, but it can be extremely useful to obtain more specific, quantitative information about how the data behave.</p>
<section id="mean" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mean">Mean</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>By far the most common way to measure the center of the distribution of numerical data is using the <strong>mean</strong>, also called the <strong>average</strong></p></li>
<li><p>We use the term <strong>sample mean</strong> when referring to the mean of observed/sampled data, which is typically denoted as <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is a placeholder for the variable of interest (e.g.&nbsp;<code>BMI</code>, <code>charges</code>)</li>
<li>The bar communicates that we are looking at the average</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The (sample) mean is the sum over all the values of the variable, divided by total number of observations <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>:</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="fragment">
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{x} = \frac{x_{1} + x_{2} + \ldots x_{n}}{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}\]</span></p>

<li><p>However, at the heart of statistics is also the <strong>variability</strong> or spread of the distribution of the variable</p></li>
<li><p>We will work with variance and standard deviation, which describe how spread out data are <em>from their mean</em></p></li>
