Unless otherwise stated, problems come from the IMS textbook.\n\nTime to implement the sampling methods we learned! Keep track of your work on this problem; we will return to it in the next few classes.\nWe have a farmer who grows sunflowers for making sunflower oil. Her field is arranged in a grid pattern, with 12 rows and 12 columns as shown below. Water is important for crops, so irrigation ditches have been installed along the top and bottom of the field. It is expected that plants closer to a water source will perform better than those further away from water.\nThe farmer would like to estimate the number of healthy plants in the field, along with a few other characteristics about the sunflowers. It would be unfeasible to conduct a census, so we should choose to sample a subset of the grid cells. Suppose we’d like to sample \\(n = 12\\) grid cells total.\n\nUsing words (sentences or bulleted list are fine) and perhaps labeling the figure below, describe exactly how you would obtain a sample of 12 grid cells using simple random sampling. I should be able to read your work and know what to do without any questions!

Now consider a new sampling scheme that is commonly used in the social sciences when sampling from a “hidden” population. A scenario might be that we want to conduct a poll among homeless people, but the research team may only have contact details for a few homeless people.\nDenote the initial contacts as Group 1. The sampling proceeds in the following stages:\n\nStage 1: ask the people in Group 1 to take the survey, and then provide contact details for other people from the population who might want to participate. Denote these new contacts as Group 2.\nStage 2: ask the people in Group 2 to take the survey, and then provide contact details for other people from the population who might want to participate. Denote these new contacts as Group 3.\nProceed in a similar manner until the researchers have sufficient data.\n\n\n\nWhat are some advantages to this method of sampling?\nWhat are some disadvantages? Think about statistically and also ethically.\n\n(2.5.20) To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400 healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days. All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients when they were sick did not. No statistically discernible differences were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the four groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of symptoms.\n\nWas this an experiment or an observational study? Why?\nWhat are the explanatory and response variables in this study?\nWere the patients blinded to their treatment?\nWas this study double-blind?\nParticipants are ultimately able to choose whether to use the pills prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to the study? Explain your reasoning."

This is an example of a function. Functions allow us to automate common tasks in a general way. Functions (just like in math) take in one or more inputs. These inputs are known as _____ or _____. They will almost always return an output. We know a command in R is a function because it has _____.\nIt is possible for us to create our own customized functions (you definitely will if you take STAT 218). However, in STAT 201, we will work with pre-provided functions. All pre-provided functions in R are accompanied by a Help file. To access the Help file, simply type ? followed by the name of the function in the Console.

So you modify as follows:\n\n2.1*2.1*2.1\n\n[1] 9.261\n\n\nThen you get told the edge length is actually 2.2. So frustrating! To save ourselves further troubles, we do the following to make our code reproducible:\n\nlength <- 2.2\nlength^3\n\n[1] 10.648\n\n\nWhat did we do in the above code? We _____ or ______ the value 2.2 into the ______ called length using the keys <-.\nNow make a new R code chunk here. In this new code chunk, make a new object called volume and assign to it an appropriate value. Now let’s knit the document.\n\n\n\nAs you should note: when we assign an object a value, its value is not automatically shown as output. In order to display the output, you must _____."

(62% to 38%)\nWhat happened? Selection and non-response bias\n\n\n\nSelection bias: Digest mailed questionnaires to 10 million people. Where did they get the address form? Telephone books and club membership lists –> screened out the poor (only about 25% of households had phones)\n\nThis wouldn’t necessarily be bias, EXCEPT for the fact that poor people overwhelmingly favored FDR and the rich favored Landon\n\nNon-response bias: lots of people didn’t respond to survey (~75%)\n\nOnce again, wouldn’t matter if there wasn’t a difference in the opinions of respondents vs non-respondents. But among the 20% who responded, over half favored Landon\nNon-respondents can be very different from respondents. When there is high non-response rate, look for non-response bias\n\nLesson: not all samples that were done poorly are necessarily biased, but we should always ask how the sample was conducted! Also, when a selection procedure is biased, a large sample does not help; this just replicates the mistake on a larger scale!"

You should note that that one of the axes has tick marks/break points that are meaningless. Add to your plot the appropriate choice of the following two functions scale_x_continuous or scale_y_continuous(), then set the breaks argument to get rid of the breaks (maybe looks at its Help file).\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing ggplot, create a histogram of the calories in Starbucks food items.

You should use the variable you created in number 3. Make this line a color of your choice. Then, add a caption that provides a brief description of what the line represents.\nUsing the plots you created, along with some summary statistics, describe the distribution of calories in Starbucks food items. Make sure you discuss shape, center, spread, and potential outliers.\n\nAnswer:\n\nNow create a scatterplot in ggplot with calories on the y-axis. For the x-axis variable, choose a variable that displays a strong association with calories. You may have to play around a bit!

In the article they explore where many Nobel laureates in the sciences were born and where they lived when they won their prize.\nIn this homework we will work with the data about Nobel laureates to recreate/update some of their visualizations with new data as well as explore new questions.\n\nlibrary(readr)\n# add more packages here as necessary\n\n\nurl_file <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/midd-stat201-fall2024/midd-stat201-fall2024.github.io/refs/heads/main/data/nobel.csv\"\nnobel <- read_csv(url_file)\n\n\nChange your name in the YAML and add the package(s) necessary for creating ggplots and wrangling data in the code chunk above. Then run the code chunk to load in the data.\n\nA description of the variables in the nobel data are as follows:\n\nid: ID number\nfirstname: first name (and possible middle initial) of laureate\nsurname: last name/surname\nyear: the year the prize was awarded\ncategory: category of prize (Chemistry, Economics, Literature, Peace, Physics, or Medicine)\nborn_year: year laureate was born\ndied_year: year laureate died\naffiliation: affiliation of laureate at time of winning\ncity: city of laureate in prize year\ncountry: country where laureate was based in prize year\ngender: gender or laureate (male, female, or org, where org represents an organization)\nborn_city: city where laureate was born\nborn_country: country where laureate was born\nborn_country_code: two-letter country code of born_country\ndied_city: city were laureate died\ndied_country: country where laureate died\ndied_country_code: two-letter country code of died_country\nshare: reciprocal of the portion of prize awarded to the laureate\nmotivation: motivation for recognition\n\nThere are a few other variables ending in _original which correspond to locations whose names changed after the prize was given. The values in these columns are the original names of the locations at the time of the award. We won’t need to work with these variables.\n\nDisplay a summary table of the sample average and standard deviation of the ages of Nobel laureates at the time of receiving the prize. Do this in a single pipeline by:\n\n\nCreating a new variable that represents the age of the laureate when they one their prize, calculated as the year they received the award minus the year they were born\nFiltering to only retain observations for which your newly calculated age variable is available\nWriting code to actually create the summary statistics\n\nBe sure to explicitly set/define the column titles of your summary table. Then interpret these statistics (particularly the standard deviation) in context.\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nCreate a new data frame called nobel_living that filters for the following criteria:\n\n\nlaureates for whom country is available\nlaureates who are people as opposed to organizations\nlaureates who are still alive\n\n\n\n\nUse code to confirm that you have 247 laureates in your new data frame:\n\n\n\n\nBuzzfeed’s Claim #1: “Most living Nobel laureates were based in the US when they won their prizes”. Let’s see if that’s true.\n\nModify (i.e. store/assign over) your nobel_living data frame by creating a new variable called country_us. The variable should equal:\n\n“USA” if the laureate’s country value is indeed the “USA”\n“Other” is the laureate’s country value is not “USA”\n\nYou will have to use the if_else() function. Take a look at its Help file (and in particular, its examples).\n\n\n\nNow would be a good time to knit your work to save the progress and make sure everything is working!\n\nCreate a new data frame called nobel_living_science that only retains observations with laureates from the Physics, Chemistry, Medicine, and Economics categories from the nobel_living data frame.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the data frame nobel_living_science, create a faceted bar plot with horizontal bars that visualizes the relationship between 1) the category of prize and 2) whether the laureate was in the US when they won the Nobel prize. Note: Your visualization should be faceted by category. For each facet you should have two bars, one for winners in the US and one for Other.\n\nInterpret your visualization, and say a few words about whether the Buzzfeed Claim #1 is supported by the data.\n\n\n\nAnswer:\nNow would be a good time to knit your work to save the progress and make sure everything is working!\n\nBuzzfeed’s Claim #2: “But of those US-based Nobel laureates, many were born in other countries.” Let’s investigate this second claim!\n\nCreate a new variable called born_country_us that has the value “USA” if the laureate is born in the US, and “Other” if not. Be sure to save the variable to the data frame by storing the output back into nobel_living_science.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s improve on our previous visualization here. Visualize the relationship between where the laureate was based when they won the Nobel Prize and where they were born, split by category. Your final visualization should:\n\n\ncontain a facet for each category\nwithin each facet, have a bar for whether the laureate won the award in the US or not\nwithin each bar, display whether the laureate was born in the US or not\n\nBased on your visualization, do the data appear to support Buzzfeed’s Claim #2? Explain your reasoning in a few sentences.\n\n\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe will explore where the non-US laureates were born. In a single pipeline starting with nobel_living_science, filter for laureates who were living in the US when they won their prize but where born outside of the US. Then create a frequency table for their birth country, only displaying the top eight countries.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, go to the Buzzfeed website linked at the top (copy and paste the URL into Chrome or Safari) and compare your frequency table from the previous exercise to their bar plot. The numbers and ordering might not be the same. Why do you think that is?\n\nAnswer:\nOnce you’re finished, knit once more. Be sure to submitted the outputted HTML file to Canvas."

Be sure to budget this time in appropriately.\n\nImportant: Prof. Tang will be proctoring the exam. On Thursday, you can expect Prof. Tang to walk around the room several times in order discourage the temptation of using Google/ChatGPT/other AI tools\n\nWhat: focusing on content from Week 5 through the beginning of Week 10 (i.e. all inference topics, Normal distribution, and SLR)\n\nLightly cumulative (but no probability problems like those on Midterm 1)\nFeel comfortable making plots and wrangling data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Wednesday: you can bring a single-sided 8.5”x11” formula sheet. This sheet should include formulas only! No worked out examples, pictures, descriptions, or definitions are allowed. You will be asked to submit the formula sheet alongside the midterm on Wednesday. The formula sheet will be returned to you for your midterm on Thursday, so be sure to write your name on your sheet.\nFor Thursday: during the coding component of the midterm, you are welcome to use/access your own code and any code posted on the course website. Aside from accessing the course website, the midterm is not open internet. Once again, use of Google/ChatGPT/other AI Tools during the midterm is strictly forbidden and would be in violation of the Honor Code.\n\nYou should bring a calculator to day 1 of the midterm. If you do not have one, the department can provide very basic calculators.\n\nYou will be provided the following two tables alongside your exam: a table of z-score probabilities and table of \\(t\\)-distribution percentiles. We will go over how to read them in class, but make sure you feel comfortable with them before the midterm!\n\nYou should bring a fully charged laptop to day 2 of the midterm.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe best preparation you can do for the midterm is to go back through your notes and homework and be honest with yourself about what you do/don’t understand. This means going through the painful process of looking at feedback on Canvas. For the concepts that you need to practice more, try more problems (see below)!\nTry answering some of the comprehension questions at the end of the slides. You should expect some questions on the midterm that assess your “big picture” understanding of the material.\nAs you’re studying, try making a rough draft of your formula sheet. Then use that formula sheet (rather than your notes) when attempting new practice problems. This will more accurately simulate the test-taking experience.\n\nBased on your experiences and practice, you should make a new version of the formula sheet. Keep iterating until you’ve found one that works for you.\nPractice the problems using the provided tables of z-score probabilities and t-distribution percentiles.\n\nFor coding, go back through your old .Rmds and make sure you understand everything that is happening! You might also consider re-doing a coding problem without looking at your previous code.\nMore practice problems will be made available soon!"

    "text": "A survey found that American families generate an average of 17.2 pounds of glass garbage each year. Assume that the standard deviation is 2.5 pounds.\nSuppose we randomly survey 40 families. Set up a calculation for (and if you have access to R, actually calculate) the probability that the mean of glass garbage of these 40 families is less than 18 pounds.\nDefine what a sampling distribution of the sample distribution is. Describe how the shape, center, and spread of the sampling distribution change as the sample size increases when \\(p=0.2\\).\nA survey of 1509 high school seniors who took the SAT and who completed an optional web survey shows that 55% of high school seniors are fairly certain that they will participate in a study abroad program in college.\n\nIs this sample a representative sample from the population of all high school seniors in the US? Explain.\nSuppose the conditions for inference are met, regardless of your answer in (a). Using a mathematical model, construct a 90% confidence interval for the proportion of high school seniors who are fairly certain they will participate in a study abroad program in college. Interpret this interval in context.\nBased on this interval, would it be appropriate to claim that the majority of high school seniors are fairly certain they will participate in a study abroad program in college?\n\n\\((^*)\\) The average teacher salary in Vermont is $62,483. Suppose that the distribution of teacher salaries is approximately normal with standard deviation $7000.\n\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected Vermont teacher makes less than $60,000 per year?\nIf we randomly sample 25 Vermont teachers and obtain their salaries, what is the probability that the mean of their salaries is less than $60,000 per year?\nCompare the probabilities in (a) and (b), and explain mathematically why one is larger than the other.\nHow would your answers to (a) and (b) change if the distribution of teacher salaries was not normal?"

The final project will give you a chance to demonstrate and celebrate your mastery over the the statistics and data science concepts you have learned this entire semester! Your group will come up with a list of research questions that you will subsequently answer using appropriate statistical methods.\nIn particular, your group will:\n\ncome up with a list of inferential research questions you are interested in answering\ndetermine your target population, create a list of variables you’d like to observe, and devise an appropriate sampling strategy\nhave a finalized data set that anyone can access and use, accompanied by a “data dictionary”\npresent your project to the class (and perhaps other professors/TAs)\nsubmit a well-written, professional report\nsubmit a reflection on the project, which will include a rubric for how much each team member contributed\n\nYou should have fun and be creative with this project!! Your research questions can be serious or funny (so long as they are PG-13 and below!)\n\nWeek 12 of the semester will be mostly devoted to project work time."

You should have at least one question per group member, but more is better!\n\nNote: we have not learned about regression yet. But we will soon learn linear regression, which answers questions about how changes in variable \\(x\\) might lead to changes in continuous variable \\(y\\)\n\nA list of variables you will observe/collect from each observational unit that you may be useful and/or required for answering your reseach question(s).\n\nYou should plan to collect at least four numerical variables (at least two of which are continuous), and at least two categorical variables\n\nA detailed description of how you plan to collect your data (i.e. survey students)\n\nHow many people do you plan to include in your data? (You should aim for least 30 people, if possible!)\nHow will you have people submit their data? (e.g. fill out a paper form, GoogleForm)\nIf you want to conduct an observational study: will you implement SRS, stratified, clustering, etc? How exactly will you implement this sampling method?\nIf you want to conduct an experiment: will you randomly recruit people to your study? How will you randomly assign treatments? (Make sure your experiment is ethical!!)\n\nA rough description of the statistical methods you might use to answer each question you listed in (2).\n\nThis might be along the lines of “hypothesis test for a single mean” or “confidence interval for a proportion” or “linear regression” along with a one-two sentence justification for the method is appropriate.\n\n\n\nIt is possible that we haven’t yet learned a method to answer some of your questions. If so, please indicate this on your proposal along with a brief justification for why you think what we have currently learned doesn’t apply.\n\n\n\nOnce you have submitted your proposal, Prof. Tang will give you feedback. Based on the feedback, your group will either have to submit a revised proposal, or you will be given the okay to go forth and collect your data.\n\n\n\nData set\n\n\nOnce you have collected your data, you should compile it all into a single Excel or GoogleSheets. Please give each variable an informative one-word name. This should be submitted to Canvas by the end of Thanksgiving break."

The different incomes columns are essentially different levels of the same categorical variable.\nSuppose I want to obtain the conditional probability of income bracket by religion type. These probabilities are VERY difficult to obtain with the data frame as is. Would would be extremely useful is if we could create a single categorical variable for the income range.\nWe will manipulate the data frame to the “long” format: the outcome variable only exists in one column, and a second column/variable tells us the different levels.
