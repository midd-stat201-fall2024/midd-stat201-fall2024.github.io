Please work on the practice problems in your group. At least one of the following problems will be assigned to the weekly problem set.

1.  If events $A$ and $B$ are disjoint:

    a.  What must $P(A \cap B)$ equal, and why?

    b.  What is a simple formula for $P(A \cup B)$?

2.  In a multiple choice exam, there are 5 questions and 4 choices for each question. Nancy has not studied for the exam at all and decides to randomly guess the answers. What is the probability that:

    a.  the first question Nancy gets correct is the 5th question?

    b.  Nancy gets all of the questions right?

    c.  Nancy gets at least one question right?

3.  In the following figure, the sample space is the set of outcomes $S = \{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$. We define three different events $A$, $B$ and $D$ as denoted by the color and circling.

    a.  Which pairs of events are disjoint?

    b.  Suppose we have a random process whose sample space is $S$ as defined above. Also suppose that $P(A) = 0.3$, $P(B) = 0.2$, and the probability of observing a 1 is $0.1$. Based on this information, create a table that represents a valid probability distribution for this random process.
