Please work on the practice problems in your group. At least one of the
following problems will be assigned to the weekly problem set.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  In Spring 2024, Prof.~Tang asked her STAT 311 students to fill out a
  mid-semester survey. She was particularly interested in the the amount
  of hours her STAT 311 students were spending per week on the course.
  The average time spent on the course was found to be 10.2 hours per
  week.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Based on this information, identify each of the following:
    observation, variable, parameter, and statistic.
  \item
    Was this survey a census or (just) a sample? Why?
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Suppose we want to estimate household size, where a
  \emph{``household''} is defined as people living together in the same
  dwelling, and sharing living accommodations. If we select students at
  random at an elementary school and ask them what their family size is,
  will this be a good measure of household size? Or will our average be
  biased? If so, will it overestimate or underestimate the true value?
\item
  To assess the effectiveness of taking large doses of vitamin C in
  reducing the duration of the common cold, researchers recruited 400
  healthy volunteers from staff and students at a university. A quarter
  of the patients were assigned a placebo, and the rest were evenly
  divided between 1g Vitamin C, 3g Vitamin C, or 3g Vitamin C plus
  additives to be taken at onset of a cold for the following two days.
  All tablets had identical appearance and packaging. The nurses who
  handed the prescribed pills to the patients knew which patient
  received which treatment, but the researchers assessing the patients
  when they were sick did not. No statistically discernible differences
  were observed in any measure of cold duration or severity between the
  four groups, and the placebo group had the shortest duration of
  symptoms.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Was this an experiment or an observational study? Why?
  \item
    What are the explanatory and response variables in this study?
  \item
    Were the patients blinded to their treatment?
  \item
    Was this study double-blind?
  \item
    Participants are ultimately able to choose whether to use the pills
    prescribed to them. We might expect that not all of them will adhere
    and take their pills. Does this introduce a confounding variable to
    the study? Explain your reasoning.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Chia seeds have gained reputation as a diet supplement. In one 2009
  study, 38 men and 38 women were recruited (i.e.~specifically chosen)
  and then divided randomly into two groups: treatment or control. One
  group was given 25 grams of chia seeds twice a day to consume, and the
  other was given a placebo. The seeds and placebo were designed to look
  the same. The subjects volunteered to be a part of the study. After 12
  weeks, the scientists found no statistically discernible difference
  between the groups in appetite or weight loss.

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \item
    What type of study is this?
  \item
    What are the experimental and control treatments in this study?
  \item
    Has blocking been used in this study? If so, what is the blocking
    variable?
  \item
    Is there any blinding in the study?
  \item
    Comment on whether we can make a causal statement, and indicate
    whether we can generalize the conclusions from this study to the
    population at large.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
