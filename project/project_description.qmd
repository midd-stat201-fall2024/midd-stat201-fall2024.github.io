## Description

As a final project, you will work in groups to collect and analyze data from fellow Middlebury students! The final project will give you a chance to demonstrate and celebrate your mastery over the the statistics and data science concepts you have learned this entire semester! Your group will come up with a list of research questions that you will subsequently answer using appropriate statistical methods.

In particular, your group will:

-   come up with a list of inferential research questions you are interested in answering

-   determine your target population, create a list of variables you'd like to observe, and devise an appropriate sampling strategy

-   have a finalized data set that anyone can access and use, accompanied by a "data dictionary"

-   present your project to the class (and perhaps other professors/TAs)

-   submit a well-written, professional report

-   submit a reflection on the project, which will include a rubric for how much each team member contributed

You should have fun and be creative with this project!! Your research questions can be serious or funny (so long as they are PG-13 and below!)

Week 12 of the semester will be mostly devoted to project work time.

## Requirements

The following looks like a lot, but is meant to provide you structure for strong final project that you are proud of!

::: {#group}
### Group creation
:::

Each group will ideally contain three people.

By the due date listed in the table above, you should either:

1.  form a group of three on your own and then e-mail Prof. Tang your decision, cc-ing everyone in the group
2.  form a group of two and then e-mail Prof. Tang your decision, cc-ing the other person in the group.
    -   Your group of two may be randomly paired with another person or pair
3.  e-mail Prof. Tang if you don't have a preference and/or want to meet new people and would like to be randomly placed in a group

::: {#proposal}
### Proposal for data collection
:::

By the due date listed in the table above, your group should submit to Canvas a document detailing the following:

1.  Your **target population(s)** of interest

2.  A list of **research questions** your group is interested in exploring/answering. You should have *at least* one question per group member, but more is better!

    -   Note: we have not learned about regression yet. But we will soon learn linear regression, which answers questions about how changes in variable $x$ might lead to changes in continuous variable $y$

3.  A list of **variables** you will observe/collect from each observational unit that you may be **useful** and/or required for answering your reseach question(s).

    -   You should plan to collect ***at least*** **four numerical** variables (at least two of which are continuous), and ***at least*** **two categorical** variables

4.  A detailed description of **how you plan to collect your data** (i.e. survey students)

    -   How many people do you plan to include in your data? (You should aim for least 30 people, if possible!)

    -   How will you have people submit their data? (e.g. fill out a paper form, GoogleForm)

    -   If you want to conduct an observational study: will you implement SRS, stratified, clustering, etc? How exactly will you implement this sampling method?

    -   If you want to conduct an experiment: will you randomly recruit people to your study? How will you randomly assign treatments? (Make sure your experiment is ethical!!)

5.  A rough **description of the statistical methods** you might use to answer each question you listed in (2).

    -   This might be along the lines of "hypothesis test for a single mean" or "confidence interval for a proportion" or "linear regression" along with a one-two sentence justification for the method is appropriate.

    <!-- -->

    -   It is possible that we haven't yet learned a method to answer some of your questions. If so, please indicate this on your proposal along with a brief justification for why you think what we have currently learned doesn't apply.

::: {style="color: maroon"}
Once you have submitted your proposal, Prof. Tang will give you feedback. Based on the feedback, your group will either have to submit a revised proposal, or you will be given the okay to go forth and collect your data.

::: {#dataset}
### Data set
:::

Once you have collected your data, you should compile it all into a single Excel or GoogleSheets. Please give each variable an informative one-word name. This should be submitted to Canvas by the end of Thanksgiving break.
