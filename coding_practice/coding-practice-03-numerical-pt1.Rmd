```{r packages, message = F}
library(openintro)
```

1.  Change your name in the YAML. Be sure to keep the quotation marks!
2.  In the following code chunk, load in the `cherry` dataset from the `openintro` package.

```{r}

```

2.  In the console, type in `?cherry` to open up the Help file for this dataset. Type into the white space below the units for each of the variables.

3.  Make a histogram of the diameter of cherry trees. Can you add a title to your plot?

```{r}

```

4.  Make a scatterplot of the diameter and volume of cherry trees. Put volume on the y-axis. Can you change the labels of the axes to be something nicer?

```{r}

```

Once you're finished, be sure to knit, commit, and push your work to Github!
